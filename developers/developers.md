## How to Get the Code

ArduSub is hosted and maintained on [github](https://github.com/ardupilot/ardupilot.git). You need to clone the repository to have full code access including submodules.

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ardupilot/ardupilot.git
    cd ardupilot
    git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Compiling

To set up your build environment, follow these instructions:

- [Mac Instructions](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-mac.html)
- [Linux Instructions](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-linux.html)
- [Windows Instructions](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-windows.html)

Before compiling ArduSub, first checkout the stable version:

```
git fetch --tags
git checkout ArduSub-stable
git submodule update --recursive
```

### MAKE (deprecated)
To compile the ArduSub branch with make, first it's necessary to be in ArduSub directory `cd ArduSub`.
The make command uses the following format:

	make [board type]

For example, to build for the Pixhawk 1:

	make px4-v2

The available board types can be seen by entering `make` with no arguments.

### WAF
Waf is a global build system for ArduPilot repository, it's necessary to be inside the root folder of ArduPilot to use it.
You can check how to use waf with:

	./waf --help

To configure waf to build ArduSub for Pixhawk 1:

	./waf configure --board px4-v2

And to compile:

	./waf build sub

#### Uploading Locally

This only works with a direct USB connection to the Pixhawk, and to upload the code:

**make**: Add `-upload` to `make` build command (only works after building with `make`).

	make px4-v2-upload

**waf**: Use `--upload` with the vehicle type (only works after configuring and building with `waf` before).

	./waf --upload sub

### Uploading Remotely

With an Ethernet tether and companion computer, it is possible to flash the Pixhawk firmware through the companion computer - no need to directly access the Pixhawk.

#### Flashing From the Command Line

	ssh pi@192.168.2.2 "/home/pi/companion/tools/flash_px4.py --stdin" < ArduSub-v2.px4

#### Flashing Via Web Interface

Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/system](http://192.168.2.2:2770/system) in your browser. Under the 'Pixhawk Firmware Update' section, click 'Browse' and select the firmware file (.px4) saved on your computer. Click 'Upload' and wait for the flashing process to complete.

## Running

The code begins running immediately once uploaded. For Linux-based autopilots, it must be launched or started with launch script. Please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.

## Making a Custom Configuration

One of the biggest additions to the ArduSub code is a six degree-of-freedom motor library that allows a wide variety of motor configurations to be set up easily. The motors libraries for each configuration are built on a set of higher-level motor classes as follows:

    AP_Motors
        |---- AP_MotorsMulticopter
                       |---- AP_MotorsMatrix
                                    |---- AP_Motors6DOF

To add a new motor configuration, you will need to add your custom motor setup to [AP_Motors6DOF.cpp](https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub/blob/master/libraries/AP_Motors/AP_Motors6DOF.cpp). Find the following line, and add your frame configuration there. The frame is configured at boot according to the FRAME_CONFIG parameter. You will need to change this parameter to CUSTOM to use your custom frame.

    case AS_MOTORS_CUSTOM_FRAME:
        // Put your custom motor setup here

The behavior of each motor will be defined by its assigned contributions to each of the 6 degrees of freedom in AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. You can use the other frame configurations as a reference guide to defining your own custom configuration. Here is the BlueROV1 frame configuration as an example:

| Motor # | Roll Factor | Pitch Factor | Yaw Factor | Throttle Factor | Forward Factor | Lateral Factor |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 1       | 0           | 0            | -1.0       | 0               | 1.0            | 0              |
| 2       | 0           | 0            | 1.0        | 0               | 1.0            | 0              |
| 3       | -0.5        | 0.5          | 0          | 0.45            | 0              | 0              |
| 4       | 0.5         | 0.5          | 0          | 0.45            | 0              | 0              |
| 5       | 0           | -1.0         | 0          | 1.0             | 0              | 0              |
| 6       | -0.25       | 0            | 0          | 0               | 0              | 1.0            |

## Troubleshooting

1. If something goes wrong while compiling:
    1. Check the [compiling](#compiling) section to set up your environment.
    2. ArduSub is only compatible with GCC 4.9. Be sure that "gcc-arm-none-eabi 4.9" is your "PATH" env with: `echo $PATH | grep gcc-arm-none-eabi`.
        1. It's also possible to add custom paths for the compiler with `export PATH=/your_path/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3/bin/:$PATH`. Run `./waf configure --board px4-v2` again if compiling with [WAF](#waf).
