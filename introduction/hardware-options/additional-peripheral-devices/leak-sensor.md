# Leak Sensor

Leak sensors are an important addition for saving an electronics enclosure should a leak occur.

ArduSub can be configured to read leak sensors through the auxiliary servo pins when set to GPIO mode. A [failsafe action]() can be configured to either send a warning or automatically surface the vehicle when a leak is detected.
