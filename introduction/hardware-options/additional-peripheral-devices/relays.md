# Relays

Relays are useful for turning higher voltage (>5V DC) auxiliary equipment on and off. 

Up to three relays can be operated via [joystick button functions](/operators-manual/button-functions.html) when connected to the appropriate signal outputs. 

Most autopilots cannot provide power to the output rail to trigger the relays, so a [5V power supply](https://bluerobotics.com/store/comm-control-power/elec-packages/bec-5v6a-r1/) will need to be connected to an empty output.
