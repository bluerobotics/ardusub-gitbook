# Servos

Servos are a useful addition to any underwater vehicle build where a component needs to be actuated or rotated. Normal servos can be installed inside the watertight enclosures to rotate things such as cameras. Depth rated servos can be used outside of enclosures.

Up to three servos can be operated via joystick button functions when connected to the appropriate signal output.

Most autopilots cannot provide power to the servos so a 5V power supply will need to be connected to the output signal rail.

# Supported Servos

ArduSub supports either analog or digital PWM controlled servos, the following have been tested:
