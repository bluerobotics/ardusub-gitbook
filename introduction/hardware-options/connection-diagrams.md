# Connection Diagrams

The following connection diagrams show how to connect devices to the ArduSub control system. 

Power distribution is not shown other than the power requirements for each device so as to illustrate clean connections. Where a voltage is not known, a "+Vin" is shown. The maximum voltage should be in accordance with the manufacturers specifications.

For more details on connections, the manufacturer's product pages and documentation should be used.
