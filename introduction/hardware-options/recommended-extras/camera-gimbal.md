# Camera Gimbal

ArduSub supports control and attitude atabilization for up to 3-axis gimbals. The most common gimbal type for underwater vehicles is a 1-axis tilt mount, since the majority of standard ROV frames have control over the other Degrees of Freedom (DoF).

ArduSub supports both simple servo-driven (PWM) gimbals in which the autopilot's onboard IMU controls the stabilisation and brushless direct drive (UART) gimbals that have their own self-stabilization controllers.
