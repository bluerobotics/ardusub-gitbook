# Pressure Sensor

An external pressure sensor is required for obtaining depth readings and enabling [Depth Hold](/reference/ardusub/features-while-in-operation.md#flight-modes) functionality. Only one sensor may be connected at a time.

ArduSub has pre-installed drivers for the following sensor types:
