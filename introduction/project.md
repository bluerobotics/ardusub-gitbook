# The ArduPilot Project

ArduSub is a part of the ArduPilot project. ArduSub is a complete open-source controller solution for subsea vehicles, offering both remotely operated control (via a number of intelligent dive modes) and execution of fully autonomous missions.

ArduSub works seamlessly with Ground Control Station software that can monitor vehicle telemetry and perform powerful mission planning activities. It also benefits from other parts of the DroneCode platform, including simulators, log analysis tools, and higher level APIs for vehicle management and control.

ArduSub is on the cutting edge of marine robotics and intended for those people who want to try advanced technology, cutting edge software, and new capabilities. It can be used on many different types of subsea vehicles including several configurations of ROVs.
