# Required Software

The ArduSub control system is made up of three major software components:

* [ArduSub Autopilot Firmware](/introduction/required-software/ardusub-autopilot-firmware.md): ArduSub firmware is the autopilot software responsible for processing pilot input and controlling the ROV. ArduSub is the 'brains' of the ROV.

* [Companion Computer Software](/introduction/required-software/companion-computer-software.md): Companion Computer software relays communications between the autopilot and QGroundControl via Ethernet communications. The Companion software also streams HD video to QGroundControl.

* [QGroundControl Software](/introduction/required-software/qgroundcontrol-software.md): QGroundControl is the user interface for operating the ROV.
