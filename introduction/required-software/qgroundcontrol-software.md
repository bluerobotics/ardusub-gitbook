Key Features:

The QGC user interface is implemented using [Qt QML](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html). QML provides for hardware acceleration which is a key feature on lower powered devices such as tablets or phones. QML also provides features which allows creation of a single user interface which can adapt itself to differing screen sizes and resolution.
