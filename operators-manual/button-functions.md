# Joystick Button Functions

Joystick buttons can be configured to perform different functions. Each button may be assigned a regular function and a shift function. To use shift functions, a button must be assigned the special **shift** function. The shift button will then act like a shift key on a keyboard; when held, it modifies the other buttons to execute their assigned shift functions. The available button functions are described below.

## General

- **none**: Do nothing, button is disabled
- **shift**: When held, act as a shift modifier for other buttons
- **arm_toggle**: Toggle the armed state of the vehicle
- **arm**: Arm the vehicle
- **disarm**: Disarm the vehicle
- **gain_toggle**: Toggle between minimum and maximum pilot input gain sensitivity
- **gain_inc**: Increase pilot input gain/sensitivity
- **gain_dec**: Decrease pilot input gain/sensitivity
- **trim_roll_inc**: Trim level target roll to the right
- **trim_roll_dec**: Trim level target roll to the left
- **trim_pitch_inc**: Trim level target pitch forward
- **trim_pitch_dec**: Trim level target pitch backward
- **input_hold_toggle**: Toggle holding current joystick axis inputs (cruise control on/off)
- **roll_pitch_toggle**: Toggle between roll/pitch and forward/lateral control on joystick input

### Roll and Pitch Control

[Presently](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/9808) (due to legacy/inheritance reasons), there is no convenient way to control the roll and pitch of and ArduSub vehicle with QGroundControl. The available solution is to use the **roll_pitch_toggle** joystick button function. When this button is pushed, the forward and lateral joystick axes toggle between controlling the forward and lateral motion of the vehicle and controlling the roll and pitch of the vehicle.

The roll and pitch input behaves differently in different flight modes. See the [flight mode documentation](/operators-manual/flight-modes) for more information about how the different flight modes operate.

- **MANUAL**: The roll and pitch input control the **rotation rate** of the vehicle. As long as the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will continue to rotate. A centered joystick input commands a rotation rate of zero.
- **ACRO**: This functions like **MANUAL**, but the rate of rotation is precisely controlled and stabilized.
- **STABILIZE**: The roll and pitch input control the **rotation rate** of the vehicle attitude. When the joystick input is centered, the vehicle will stabilize and hold the current attitude. Press the **roll_pitch_toggle** joystick button while the vehicle is deflected to lock the current deflection angle and return to controlling forward and lateral motion. To clear the roll and pitch input command, switch to **MANUAL** mode, or press the **mount_center** button while roll/pitch control is active.
- **DEPTH HOLD**: This functions like **STABILIZE** mode.

## Mode Selection
