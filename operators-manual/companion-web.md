#Companion Web Interface

When a Companion computer is connected to a ground computer, a user can access the web-interface on [192.168.2.2:2770](http://192.168.2.2:2770). Users can access Network, System, Camera and Routing pages alongside a number of other user friendly options as described below.

##Companion Header
