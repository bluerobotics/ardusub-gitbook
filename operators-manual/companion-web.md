# Companion Web Interface

The Companion computer([Install instructions](/getting-started/installation.md#raspberry-pi)) hosts a useful web-interface with different pages for accessing parameters and functionalities associated with Companion. When a Companion computer is connected to a ground computer, a user can access the web-interface on [192.168.2.2:2770](http://192.168.2.2:2770). Users can access Network, System, Camera and Routing pages alongside a number of other user friendly options as described below.

## Companion Header

The web interface header displays the Companion software version. It provides navigation links to the main configuration pages available in the web interface, options to restart and shutdown the Companion computer, and a switch to enable advanced options on the current page (if available).

## Network

The web interface by default opens at the [Network](http://192.168.2.2:2770/network) page. This page allows users to:

- Configure WiFi
- Check WiFi and Internet Status 
- Configure Ethernet IP address
- Test the network for Uploads and Downloads
- Ethernet network configuration (advanced): The Ethernet interface can be configured as DHCP Server, DHCP Client or Manual (static) mode.
  - Manual: Manual: The interface is configured with a static IP address. This is the default configuration. The default IP address is 192.168.2.2.
  - DHCP Server: The interface is configured as a DHCP server on the 192.168.2.x subnet. The interface IP address will be 192.168.2.2 in this mode.
  - DHCP Client: This is useful for connecting to a router.

<img src="/images/system2.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

## Camera

The [Camera](http://192.168.2.2:2770/camera) page allows the user to view and make changes to:
 
- Detailed camera settings including Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Sharpness, etc. among others
- Video Streaming settings including selecting a video device, format and frame size

<img src="/images/camera.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

## Routing

The [Routing](http://192.168.2.2:2770/routing) page can be used to route serial communications between serial devices and network ports. It can be used to create one-to-one, and one-to-many connections. The configuration on this page is persistent and loaded at boot. The configuration is stored in the file `~/routing.conf`.

> **Note:** This program is written in python and is not optimized or well-suited for high-bandwidth applications. The maximum recommended baudrate is 115200. If high bandwidth routing is required, standard linux tools like `tty`, `socat` and `netcat` should be used instead.

<img src="/images/companion-routing/routing-setup.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

To use the companion routing tool:

- create one or more endpoints with your desired configuration
- add connections between the endpoints as you want
- remove connections by clicking the 'broken link' button next to the configuration
- remove endpoints by clicking the 'trash can' button next to the configuration

<img src="/images/companion-routing/configuration.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

### Endpoints

An endpoint can be a serial port or a network port. Create an endpoint by entering the desired port settings, and click 'create link'.

**Serial Endpoints**

Select one of the available serial ports from the drop down list, and choose the baudrate to use. The serial port must not be in use by another program! Click 'Add Serial Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.

<img src="/images/companion-routing/serial-endpoint.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

**UDP Endpoints**

Enter the ip address and UDP port to use. If the ip address is '0.0.0.0', it will bind the local port as a server. All other ip addresses will result in a client connection. Click 'Add UDP Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.

<img src="/images/companion-routing/udp-endpoint.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:750px" />

### Routes

Endpoints can be connected bidirectionally (typical), or with a one way connection. To begin routing communications between endpoints, choose the endpoints that you wish to connect, the direction to route communications, and click 'connect'.

### Example configurations

#### Topside as UDP Server

To bridge serial communications between a device connected to the companion computer inside the ROV, and the existing network connection to the topside computer:

 1. Create a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate
 2. Create a UDP endpoint using the topside computer IP address **192.168.2.1**, and the port that the topside application will bind.
 3. Connect them bidirectionally
 4. The application on the topside computer should bind the UDP port as a server

To test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with "netcat" on the topside computer: `nc -ulp <port>`

> **Note:** Topside as UDP Server mode is not recommended for master-slave setups. For the connection to be properly stabilished, the serial device must send some data. Only then the connection is stabilished and the topside is able to send data to the companion.

This python script exemplifies how to run an UDP server with Python:

```Python
"""
Companion routing UDP server example.

This script Binds to an UDP port and receives data from the Companion at
a given port.
You should run this at your topside computer.
"""
import socket

UDP_IP = "192.168.2.1" # Topside (local) IP
UDP_PORT = 5555        # Topside (local) port to listen on

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, # Internet
                    socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # UDP
sock.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))

while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024) # Buffer size is 1024 bytes
    print(data.decode())
```

#### Companion as UDP Server

 1. Create a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate
 2. Create a UDP endpoint using the **0.0.0.0** IP address, and the port that the server will bind to.
 3. Connect them bidirectionally
 4. The application on the topside computer should connect to **192.168.2.2** at the port chosen in step two

To test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with "netcat" on the topside computer: `nc -u 192.168.2.2 <port>`

This Python example shows how to communicate using these UDP ports:

```Python
"""
Companion routing UDP client example.

This script connects to a endpoint at the Companion exposed using the IP 0.0.0.0
and a given port. It then sends some data so the server knows it has a client
and starts relaying the serial data back at it.
You should run this at your topside computer.
"""
import socket
import time

UDP_IP = "192.168.2.2" # Remote (Companion's) IP to connect to
UDP_PORT = 5555        # Remote (Companion's) port to connect to
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

try:
    # Send something so the server knows where to reply to
    sent = sock.sendto(b"hello", (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
    # Loop receiving data
    while True:
        data, server = sock.recvfrom(4096)
        print(data.decode())
        time.sleep(0.01)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    sock.close()
```

<!--
To create a fake serial device `/dev/ttyVirt` under linux, do `socat PTY,link=/dev/ttyS0,group=uucp,perm=0660,ignoreeof UDP-LISTEN:5000`
You can then use it with applications, try `screen /dev/ttyVirt` for example.

Note: This is not enough! some applications, such as Arduino, do not find this port, and screen fails to release it when detaching.
