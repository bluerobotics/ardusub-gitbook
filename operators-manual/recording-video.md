# Recording Video

QGroundControl supports recording the video stream directly to the receiving device. If you would like to record your video with the QGroundControl application elements displayed, you should use a separate screen recording software. 

The video is saved under the path selected in the *General* tab of the *Application Settings* page. The default path is User/Documents/QGroundControl.

To record video in QGroundControl, click the "down arrow" in the <a href="https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/en/FlyView/FlyView.html#instrument_panel">instrument panel</a> to show the drop down menu. 

Select the *Video Stream* page option from the dropdown. 

Click the red circle at the bottom of the Video Stream page. 

The red video recording icon is a square when QGroundControl is currently recording the video stream to a file. When QGroundControl is not recording video, the red video recording icon is a circle. Each time the red circle is clicked to start recording, a new video file is created. The videos are saved in Matroska format (.mkv) by default. Matroska was chosen because it is robust against corruption in case of errors. Other formats are supported and can be selected on the *General* tab of the *Application Settings* page. If you would like to use your video in another format, you must convert the .mkv file with a transcoding program like VLC.

## VLC

VLC can record and display the received video. To receive the video video from companion, it's necessary
to go in: **Media** → **Open Network Stream** → **http://192.168.2.2:2770/vlc.sdp** → **play**.

Note: It's possible to configure the caching size of VLC to allow a faster time response from the video, this configuration
is done under: **Media** → **Open Network Stream** → **Show more options** → **Set caching to a number around 200** → **play**
