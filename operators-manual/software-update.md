## Companion

Companion software release notes are [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluerobotics/companion/master/release-notes.txt). To perform a companion update update:

- Plug a _fully charged_ battery into the ROV and connect the tether to your computer.
- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/network](http://192.168.2.2:2770/network) in your browser and ensure that the ROV has access to a WiFi network. If you do not see a webpage at this address, you need to perform the update according to the instructions [here](http://discuss.bluerobotics.com/t/software-updates/1128).
- Navigate to [192.168.2.2:2770/system](http://192.168.2.2:2770/system). Click the button that says 'Update companion'. If you do not see this button, then the companion software is up to date.
- The update process will take between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the Internet connection speed. Wait for the update process to complete.
- When it completes, refresh your browser. The companion version should be updated, and the update available message should no longer appear.
- If the update fails (usually due to a loss of internet connectivity), you will be warned that the ROV will reboot and to leave the battery plugged in. At this point, once you are able to refresh the webpage, it is safe to either power down the ROV or attempt the update again.
