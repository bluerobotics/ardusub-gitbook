# ArduSub Configuration and Features

When an autopilot board with ArduSub firmware is connected, the default QGC interface changes to a customized one for ArduSub vehicles. A few pages on the [Vehicle Setup View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/vehicle-setup-view.md) are different from other ArduPilot vehicle types and any setting or section labeled "PX4 Only" will not apply.
