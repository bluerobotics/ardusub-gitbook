1. Click on the corresponding vehicle frame that was originally picked out in the "[Building a Vehicle Frame](/quick-start/vehicle-frame.md)" section of this documentation.
2. Reboot the vehicle or autopilot for the frame selection to be saved and loaded on the next start.

## Loading Default Parameters for _BlueROV2_

Default parameters only exist for the *BlueROV2* and *BlueROV2 Heavy*. If using another frame type, parameter settings will need to be manually checked and configured.
