# Tuning Setup Page

This page allows changing the PID controller gains to better suit your vehicle and application. Changing these may help you get a snappier response for more precise movements, or a smoother response for recording cinematic footages.

Adjust a parameter by moving the desired slider, or by clicking the increase/decrease buttons. There are three controllers that can be adjusted here:

* **Attitude Controller Parameters** are the parameters for the controller responsible for keeping the vehicle oriented as you want it, assuming your vehicle has ability (enough motors/DOF) to do so.

* **Position Controller Parameters** are the parameters for the controller responsible for positioning the vehicle at a point in 3D space. The **Z** parameters control how the depth control works (eg in **Depth Hold** mode). The **XY** parameters affect how the vehicle controls the horizontal position in Position Enabled modes.

* **Waypoint Navigation Parameters** are the parameters for the controller responsible for following waypoints in **Auto** and **Guided** mode.

> **Note** **Guided** and **Auto** modes are currently unsupported and some features are disabled in QGC.
