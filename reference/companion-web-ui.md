# Companion Web Interface

The Companion computer([Install instructions](/getting-started/installation.md#raspberry-pi)) hosts a useful web-interface with different pages for accessing parameters and functionalities associated with Companion. When a Companion computer is connected to a ground computer, a user can access the web-interface on [192.168.2.2:2770](http://192.168.2.2:2770). Users can access Network, System, Camera and Routing pages alongside a number of other user friendly options as described below.

## Companion Header

The web interface header displays the Companion software version. It provides navigation links to the main configuration pages available in the web interface, options to restart and shutdown the Companion computer, and a switch to enable advanced options on the current page (if available).
