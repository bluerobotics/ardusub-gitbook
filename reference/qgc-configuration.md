# QGroundControl Features and Configuration

QGroundControl (QGC) is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ArduSub, which provides setup and control functionality. It is installed on the [Topside Computer](/introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/topside-computer.md).

QGC has been designed to configure and fly many different types of vehicles (copters, planes, rovers, boats, subs) and firmware types ([ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/index.html) and [PX4](https://px4.io/)).

> **Note** When an autopilot board with ArduSub firmware is connected, the default QGC interface changes to a customized one for ArduSub vehicles. A few pages on the _Vehicle Setup View_ are different from other ArduPilot vehicle types and any setting or section labeled "PX4 Only" will not apply.

## Quick Start

1. [Download and install]() QGroundcontrol for your operating system.
2. Start QGroundControl.
3. Turn on and connect an ArduSub vehicle. If using a Companion Computer, the [Network Settings]() will need to be configured. QGroundControl should detect the vehicle and connect to it automatically.

## Organization

QGC is organized with the following sections and views:

* [Main Toolbar](/reference/qgroundcontrol/main-toolbar.md)
* [Applications Settings View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/application-settings-view.md)
* [Vehicle Setup View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/vehicle-setup-view.md)
* [Plan View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/plan-view.md)
* [Fly View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/fly-view.md)
* [Analyze View](/reference/qgroundcontrol/analyze-view.md)
