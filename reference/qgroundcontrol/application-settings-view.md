# Application Settings View

The _Application Settings View_ is used to configure the settings for the QGroundControl application (rather than a specific vehicle). You do not have to have a vehicle connected to change these values.

You can switch between the various pages by clicking the buttons in the left-sidebar.

#### Autoconnect Devices

This section defines the set of devices to which QGroundControl will auto-connect.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-autoconnect.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

Settings include:
* **Pixhawk:** Autoconnect to Pixhawk-series device
* **SiK Radio:** Autoconnect to SiK (Telemetry) radio
* **PX4 Flow:** Autoconnect to PX4Flow device
* **LibrePilot:** Autoconnect to Libre Pilot autopilot
* **UDP:** Autoconnect to UDP
* **RTK GPS:** Autoconnect to RTK GPS device
* **NMEA GPS Device:** Autoconnect to an external GPS device to get ground station position (see below)

##### Ground Station Location (NMEA GPS Device)

QGroundControl will automatically use an internal GPS to display its own location on the map with a purple "Q" icon (if the GPS provides a heading, this will be also indicated by the icon).

You can also configure QGC to connect to an external GPS device via a serial or UDP port. The GPS device must support the ASCII NMEA format - this is normally the case.

Use the NMEA GPS Device drop-down selector to manually select the GPS device and other options:
* USB connection:
    * **NMEA GPS Device:** Serial
    * **NMEA GPS Baudrate:** The baudrate for the serial port

* Network connection:
    * **NMEA GPS Device:** UDP Port.
    * **NMEA Stream UDP Port:** The UDP port on which QGC will listen for NMEA data (QGC binds the port as a server)
    
> **NOTE** To troubleshoot serial GPS problems: Disable RTK GPS auto connection, close QGroundControl, reconnect your GPS, and open QGC.

#### RTK GPS

This feature does not work with ArduSub.

#### ADSB Server

This feature does not work with ArduSub.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-adsb.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

#### Video

The Video section is used to define the source and connection settings for video that will be displayed in Fly View.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-video.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

The settings are:
* **Video Source:** Video Stream Disabled | RTSP Video Stream | UDP h.264 Video Stream | UDP h.265 Video Stream | TCP-MPEG2 Video Stream | MPEG-TS (h.264) Video Stream | Integrated Camera
* **URL/Port:** Connection type-specific stream address (may be port or URL).
* **Aspect Ratio:** Aspect ratio for scaling video in video widget (set to 0.0 to ignore scaling)
* **Disabled When Disarmed:** Disable video feed when vehicle is disarmed.
* **Low Latency Mode:** Enabling low latency mode reduces the video stream latency, but may cause frame loss and choppy video (this is enabled by default whan an ArduSub vehicle is connected).

#### Video Recording

The Video Recording section is used to specify the file format and maximum allocated file storage for storing video. Videos are saved to a sub-directory ("Video") of the Application Load/Save Path.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-video-recording.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

The settings are:
* **Auto-Delete Files:** If checked, files are auto deleted when the specified amount of storage is used.
    * **Max Storage Usage:** Maximum video file storage before video files are auto deleted.
* **Video File Format:** File format for the saved video recording: mkv, mov, mp4.

#### Brand Image

This setting specifies the brand image used for indoor/outdoor colour schemes.
The brand image is displayed in place of the default ArduSub logo in the top right corner of the toolbar. It is provided so that users can easily create screen/video captures that include a company logo/branding.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-brand-image.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

The settings are:
* **Indoor Image:** Brand image used in indoor color scheme
* **Outdoor Image:** Brand image used in outdoor color scheme
* **Reset Default Brand Image:** Reset the brand image back to default.

### Comm Links Page

Allows you to manually create communication links and connect to them. Keep in mind that normally this is not needed since QGroundControl will automatically connect to the most common devices.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-comm-links.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-comm-links-udp.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

### Offline Maps

Offline Maps allows you to cache map tiles for use when not connected to the internet. You can create multiple offline sets, each for a different location.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-general-offline-maps.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

To use:
1. To create a new offline map set, click "Add new set". 
2. From here you can name you set as well as specify the zoom levels you want to cache. 
3. Move the map to the position you can to cache and then set the zoom levels and click Download to cache the tiles.
4. To the left you can see previews of the min and max zoom levels you have chosen.

### Mavlink

The MAVLink settings allow you to configure options and view information specific to MAVLink communications. This includes setting the MAVLink system ID for QGroundControl and viewing link quality.

<img src="/images/reference/reference-qgc-application-settings-mavlink.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-height:600px;">

#### Ground Station

This section sets the MAVLink properties and behaviour of QGroundControl.

* **MAVLink System ID:** System ID of QGroundControl on the MAVLink network (Default: 255). Vehicles are typically allocated IDs from 1. 
* **Emit heartbeat:** Disable emission of regular MAVLink HEARTBEAT message (Default: True). Generally speaking, you should not turn this off.
* **Request start of MAVLink telemetry streams (ArduPilot only):** Enable QGroundControl requesting the standard-rate ArduPilot telemetry streams (Default: True). If non-standard rates are required (e.g. if the vehicle is connecting over a slow link) then you can disable starting the standard streams so that the vehicle can control streaming rates.
* **Only accept MAVs with the same protocol version:** Set true to only connect to MAVLink 1 or to MAVLink 2 vehicles (Default: True).

#### Telemetry Stream Rates

This section sets the stream rates of the data coming from the vehicle.

* **All Streams Controlled by Vehicle Settings:** Defaults to values set by _SR"X"__ parameters.
* **Raw Sensors:**
* **Extended Ststus:**
* **RC Channel:**
* **Position:**
* **Extra 1:**
* **Extra 2:**
* **Extra 3:**

#### Link Status

This shows the status of MAVLink message transfer over the communications link. A high Loss rate may lead to protocol errors for things like parameter download or mission upload/download.

### Console

Used to capture application logs for help with diagnosing application problems.
