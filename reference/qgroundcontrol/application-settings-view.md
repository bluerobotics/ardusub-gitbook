# Application Settings View

The _Application Settings View_ is used to configure the settings for the QGroundControl application (rather than a specific vehicle). You do not have to have a vehicle connected to change these values.

You can switch between the various pages by clicking the buttons in the left-sidebar.

## Pages

**General Settings Page**: The main application configuration settings. These are used to specify: display units, autoconnection devices, video display and storage, etc.

**Comm Links Page**: Allows you to manually create communication links and connect to them. Keep in mind that normally this is not needed since QGroundControl will automatically connect to the most common devices.

**Offline Maps**: Allows you to cache maps for use while you have no Internet connection.

**Mavlink**: Settings associated with the MAVLink connection to a vehicle.

**Console**: Used to capture application logs for help with diagnosing application problems.
