# Plan View

The Plan View is used to plan autonomous missions for your vehicle, and upload them to the vehicle. Once the mission is planned and sent to the vehicle, you switch to the [Fly View]() to run the mission.

> **Note** ArduSub 4.0 is not capable of conducting planned missions. After this capability is functional, this page will be updated.
