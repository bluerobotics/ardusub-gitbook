 ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️\nThis documentation is being split up, and transferred to other sites:\n\nArduSub is being moved to the ArduPilot wiki (GitHub)\nThe Blue Robotics Companion Software has been replaced by BlueOS (GitHub)\nControl Station Software (GCS) documentation can be found at\nQGroundControl (GitHub)\nCockpit (GitHub)\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nNote The information in this guide applies to ArduSub V3.5 and up. If you are running an older version, you should update.\n\nArduSub and the ArduPilot Project\nThe ArduSub project is a fully-featured open-source solution for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). ArduSub is a part of the ArduPilot project, and was originally derived from the ArduCopter code. ArduSub has extensive capabilities out of the box including feedback stability control, depth and heading hold, and autonomous navigation.\nArduSub is designed to be safe, feature-rich, open-ended, and easy to use even for novice users.\nArduSub works seamlessly with Ground Control Station software that can monitor vehicle telemetry and perform powerful mission planning activities. It also benefits from other parts of the ArduPilot platform, including simulators, log analysis tools, and higher level APIs for vehicle management and control.\nArduSub is on the leading edge of marine robotics and intended for anyone who wants to operate a vehicle below the water's surface. There is support for many different ROV configurations, and adding a custom design is simple.\nAbout this Book\nThis book is an on-going work in progress to document the ArduSub software as well as supporting software and hardware. The documentation in this book is based on the most recent software available at the time of writing. In some cases, features or options documented here may be only available in developmental versions of the software. The authoring of this book and the ArduSub project are sponsored by Blue Robotics.\nLicense\n\nThe ArduSub and ArduPilot code are released under the GPLv3 License.\nThis book is released under the CC-NC-SA 4.0 License.\n\n"},"introduction/features.html":{"url":"introduction/features.html","title":"Features","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nArduSub has many features including:\n\nBuilt-in support for several vehicle frame options and motor configurations (custom configurations are possible too)\nHigh extensibility in software and hardware for customization\nAttitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) and Inertial Navigation Filter (EKF)\nExtensive user-configurable parameter system\nWell developed ground control station software for piloting and configuration\nCompatibility with many development tools targeting MAVLink-enabled vehicles\nSensor and data logging\nNo Programming Required\n\nSupported Frames\nArduSub includes a high-level motor library that can configure motors in any configuration. This library is used to implement a number of supported frame configurations. All configurations are shown from top-down view. Green thrusters indicate counter-clockwise propellers and blue thrusters indicate clockwise propellers (or vice-versa).

(Frame: simplerov)\n        \n    \n\n\nSupported Hardware\nThe ArduPilot project has support for a great variety of hardware platforms. ArduSub firmware is provided for many of these platforms, but only the Pixhawk 1 is fully tested and supported.\nThese are platforms that have been reported to work with ArduSub:\n\nPixhawk\nPixhawk 2\nPixhawk Mini\n\nPlease let us know if you have tested ArduSub on another platform!\nCapabilities\n\nFeedback control and stability: Based on a multicopter autopilot system, the ArduSub controller has accurate feedback control to actively maintain orientation.\nDepth hold: Using pressure-based depth sensors, the ArduSub controller can maintain depth within a few centimeters.\nHeading hold: By default, the ArduSub automatically maintains its heading when not commanded to turn.\nCamera Tilt: Camera tilt control with servo or gimbal motors through the joystick or gamepad controller.\nLight Control: Control of subsea lighting through the joystick or gamepad controller.\n\nExtensibility\nIn addition to the standard onboard sensors (IMU, compass), the ArduSub controller directly supports a number of external sensors including:\n\nPressure/depth sensors for measurement and auto depth-hold (such as the Bar30)\n\nOther sensors, and in particular high-bandwidth and specialized sensors, are integrated as Companion sensors, attached to the companion computer and running alongside ArduSub and sharing communication pathways. This allows rapid integration of new and unique payloads and allows you to use the manufacturer's user interface to control the sensor.\nSensors integration via companion includes sensors such as:\n\nDepth sounders (the Ping Sonar)\nUDP Input of external GPS data from underwater localization systems (such as the Water Linked Underwater GPS)\nScanning Sonars (the Ping360 Scanning Imaging Sonar)\n\nWith upcoming sensors:\n\nConductivity sensors\n\n"},"introduction/applications.html":{"url":"introduction/applications.html","title":"Applications","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications\nArduSub provides the functionality needed for a wide variety of applications from simple observation-class ROVs to sophisticated research-class ROVs.

Reference the connection diagrams to understand how each component is connected.\nRecommended Extras: These components are not required for operation, but are highly recommended for underwater vehicles.\nAdditional Peripheral Devices: These components are not required for operation, but greatly enhance the capabilities of an ArduSub vehicle.\n\n"},"introduction/hardware-options/connection-diagrams.html":{"url":"introduction/hardware-options/connection-diagrams.html","title":"Connection Diagrams","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection Diagrams\nThe following connection diagrams show how to connect devices to the ArduSub control system. \nPower distribution is not shown other than the power requirements for each device so as to illustrate clean connections. Where a voltage is not known, a \"+Vin\" is shown. The maximum voltage should be in accordance with the manufacturers specifications.\nFor more details on connections, the manufacturer's product pages and documentation should be referenced.\nMinimum Required and Recommended Hardware\n\n\nComponents are not shown to scale, some are enlarged to show connection locations.\n\nFor clarity reasons, power distribution connections are not shown but the input voltage ranges are.\n\n\nRequired Hardware Overview\n\nAutopilot: The autopilot board/flight controller board processes the pilot input and sensor data, and controls the motors, lights, servos, and relays on the vehicle. It runs the ArduSub firmware.\n\nCompanion Computer: The Companion Computer streams video to the Topside Computer, and relays MAVLink communications between the autopilot and the Topside Computer via Ethernet.\n\nTopside Computer: The topside computer is where the live video feed and telemetry information are received and displayed. It accepts operator input from a joystick to allow controlling the connected vehicle.\n\nJoystick: A joystick allows the operator to control the vehicle, using stick control movements and button presses.\n\nCamera: The camera allows the pilot to see and record from the vehicle's point of view. If paired with a Camera Tilt Mount or other gimbal it can be moved during operation.\n\nElectronic Speed Controls (ESCs): ESCs are used to control the speed/thrust of motors and thrusters.\n\nThrusters: Thrusters are necessary to maneuver an underwater vehicle around. The number and orientation of thrusters on a vehicle determines the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) it may maneuver in.\n\nPower Sensing Module: A power sensing module provides analog current and voltage sensing to an autopilot onboard the vehicle. It's used to measure battery level, and how much power the vehicle is using.\n\nPower Supply: The power supply and distribution system powers all the onboard electronics, including the high current draw of the thrusters. A regulator converts the main supplied power (from a battery or otherwise) into appropriate voltages for the more sensitive electronics - it must ensure a steady supply to avoid the computers restarting and losing control of the vehicle.\n\nTether: A tether is a length of cable which connects the Companion Computer to the Topside Computer. It allows low latency high-bandwidth communication to a vehicle in water, which other technologies are poorly suited to.\n\n\nRecommended Extras Overview\n\nPressure Sensor: An external pressure sensor is required for estimating the vehicle's depth. They often come with a simple temperature sensor included.\n\nCamera Tilt Mount: A camera tilt mount or other gimbal is used for moving and/or stabilising the camera, for smoother video feeds and looking around without needing to rotate or move the whole vehicle.\n\nLights: Lights are important for visual inspections and navigation, especially at night time, under cover, or at depths where sunlight doesn't reach.\n\n\nAdditional Peripheral Devices Overview\n\nLeak Sensors: Leak sensors help to detect and warn about if a leak occurs, before it gets to and damages the electronics in an enclosure.\nTemperature Sensor: An auxiliary temperature sensor can be connected to obtain faster and more accurate readings than from an integrated pressure sensor. This can be helpful in research, or where accurate temperature is important for estimating some other related phenomenon.\nServos: Servos are useful when a component needs to be actuated or rotated. They can be inside an enclosure to rotate things such as cameras, or depth-rated and used outside of enclosures.\nRelays: Relays are useful for turning higher voltage (>5V DC) auxiliary equipment on and off.\nGrippers and Manipulators: A gripper is a useful tool for picking up small objects, attaching recovery lines, or freeing a snagged tether. Other manipulators may be useful in cleaning, inspection, or repair tasks.\nUnderwater Positioning and GPS (SBL and USBL): A positioning system is useful for navigation (going to a location, displaying the current position on a map), as well as location-tagging collected data.\nSonars: Sonars are useful where visibility is low, for getting range measurements to surfaces or acoustically imaging targets.

The power supply needs to be able to power all the onboard electronics and keep up with the current draw of the thrusters.\nThe working voltage is usually tied to the maximum voltage rating of the thrusters. Voltage regulators step down higher voltages into lower ones to power the electronics.\nBattery Power\nFor safety reasons, it is recommended to design an underwater vehicle to operate on battery power. Lithium type batteries are a popular choice due to their high storage capacity in a compact form factor. When selecting a battery for a new vehicle, here are a few important considerations:\n\nVoltage: Lithium batteries often specify their nominal pack voltage as well as a corresponding \"S\" rating indicating the number of 3.7V cells in wired in Series inside the battery. The voltage of your battery needs to be matched to the ratings of your ESCs and thrusters.\n\nFor example, Blue Robotics Basic ESCs support 2S through 6S (7-26V) batteries, however the T200 Thruster is only rated for a maximum of 20V. Therefore, the the maximum recommended battery to use in this system is a 4S battery as a fully charged battery is 16.8V.\n\n\nCapacity Batteries usually specify their capacity in units of mAh, the larger this number, the more energy the battery will store, and the longer you can run your ROV.\n\nCurrent Rating: Batteries usually specify a C rating for Current. In order to calculate the rated current in Amps, multiply the capacity of the battery in Ah (mAh/1000) times the C rating. For example, a 10000 mAh (10 Ah) battery with a 10C rating is rated for 100 Amps. As a general rule of thumb, your battery should be rated for a continuous current draw of 15 Amps times the number of thrusters.\n\n\nA battery will also need its own watertight enclosure (WTE) unless space is allocated inside the main electronics enclosure.\n\nThese batteries are known to fit inside a 3\" inner diameter (WTE):\n\nBlue Robotics Lithium-ion Battery (14.8V, 18Ah)\nBlue Robotics Lithium-ion Battery (14.8V, 15.6Ah)\nTurnigy Li-po (14.8V, 10Ah) (Hobby King)\n\nPower Over Tether (High Voltage)\nWith the inherent danger of high voltage around water, the ArduSub developers highly discourage users from making their own high voltage power supplies.\nIf a power over tether solution is required, then Blue Robotics sells the Outland Technology Power Supply (OTPS) for the BlueROV2. Although the OTPS system was resigned to replace the battery enclosure on the BlueROV2, it can be adapted for other vehicle projects.\n\nVoltage Regulators\nDepending on the electronics used, the primary voltage of the vehicle will most likely need to be stepped down and regulated more more sensitive electronics such as Companion Computers and autopilots. \nThe following regulators have been tested to provide adequate power:\n\nBlue Robotics 5V 6A Power Supply\n\n"},"introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/tether.html":{"url":"introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/tether.html","title":"Tether","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTether\nA tether is a length of cable which connects the Companion Computer to the Topside Computer. Radio frequency (RF) waves do not travel far through water and acoustic modems have limited bandwidth, so a tether is a critical component to connect the vehicle to a surface computer.\nRequirements\nThe Companion Computer communicates by 10/100 Base Ethernet. Therefore, a standard Cat 5 cable may be used to connect to the vehicle and topside computer. The maximum transmission length of Cat5 cable is around 100m.\n\nTether Interfaces\nAlthough optional and not necessary for basic functionality, tether interfaces increase the range and reliability of Ethernet communications.\nInterfaces for Copper Twisted Wire Pairs\nInterface boards which use the Homeplug AV standard provide a robust high-speed, long-distance Ethernet connection over a single pair of wires. These boards enable HD video and high-bandwidth data over 300m+ tether lengths.\n\nThe following interface boards are supported:\n\nBlue Robotics Fathom-X Tether Interface Board Set\n\nInterfaces for Fiber Optic Cable\nWith communications being Ethernet based, fiber optic cables may also be used with Ethernet-to-Fiber converters installed inside the ROV and topside.\nThe following fiber optic interface boards have been known to work: \n\nDeltaROV Subsea Fiber to Ethernet Communication Kit\n\n"},"introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/topside-computer.html":{"url":"introduction/hardware-options/required-hardware/topside-computer.html","title":"Topside Computer","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopside Computer\nThe topside computer runs the QGroundControl application and is the device in which the Companion Computer on the vehicle is connected to.

The position-enabled flight modes are considered stable and do not work as of the latest firmware release. This page will be updated when functionality is added.\n\nGPS Module\nArduSub maintains the same GPS module drivers as the rest of the ArduPilot family of firmwares, so a compatible GPS module may be directly connected to the GPS port on the autopilot. Positioning information will only be available when the vehicle is on the surface and the module is out of the water. The module will not be able to obtain a fix if it is underwater due to high frequency radio waves being unable to penetrate the water medium.\nAcoustic positioning systems are the only reliable way of providing positioning information underwater.\nSBL Positioning Systems\nA short baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning system uses an acoustic transmitter on the vehicle to transmit timed acoustic pulses. These pulses are received by a series of multiple receivers on the surface in an arraged geometric pattern. The \"time of flight\" is calculated to when each receiver records the acoustic pulse and then a consolidated position for the underwater vehicle can be plotted.\nSBL systems can produce better positioning accuracy in highly reflective environments due to the adjustable receiver locations.\n\nSupported SBL Systems\n\nWater Linked Underwater GPS Explorer Kit\n\nUSBL Positioning Systems\nAn ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning system is similar to SBL system where and acoustic pulse is transmitted from a tranciever on the vehicle and then recieved by a receiver on the surface.

An altimeter is a single-beam sonar which gets a range measurement from the bottom of the ROV to the seabed. This is useful in low visibility situations where the distance to the bottom is unknown.\nIn addition to getting a distance reading, echosounders can provide the full echo response (echo strength versus time) which can be plotted like the display of a fishfinder sonar.

Some frames use less thrusters, while others have better manueverability (strafe, pitch/roll stability).\nArduSub includes a high-level motor library that can configure motors in any configuration. This library is used to implement a number of supported frame configurations. \nAll configurations are shown from top-down view. Green thrusters indicate counter-clockwise propellers and blue thrusters indicate clockwise propellers (or vice-versa). The numbers next to each thruster correspond to the numbered main output on the autopilot board when the ESC signal wires are plugged in.\nCurrently supported are:\n\n    \n        \n            \n            BlueROV1 Configuration with 6-DOF thruster positioning.

Click the button under the Pixhawk Firmware Update section that says Stable.\n\nWait for the update process to complete, and you are finished!\n\n\nWithout a Companion Computer (Manual Installation)\n\nOpen QGroundControl and navigate Firmware page.\nPlug in the Pixhawk to the computer's USB port. Once detected, QGroundControl will show a firmware selection box on the right. \nChoose \"ArduPilot Flight Stack\", then select \"ChibiOS\", \"Sub\", and (assuming you are using a Pixhawk) \"Pixhawk1\" from the dropdown list.\n\n\n\nPress \"OK\" at the top right. \nThe firmware will upload the Pixhawk and you'll see the following printout and success message. The Pixhawk will reboot and then will automatically connect with QGroundControl.\n\n\nFrame Selection\n\nGo the Frame Setup page.\nClick on the corresponding vehicle frame that was originally picked out in the \"Building a Vehicle Frame\" section of this documentation.\nReboot the vehicle or autopilot for the frame selection to be saved and loaded on the next start.\n\n\n\nNote Default parameters only exist for the BlueROV2 and BlueROV2 Heavy. If using another frame type, parameter settings will need to be manually configured in the following steps. \n\nCompleting Calibrations\nBefore an ArduSub vehicle may be used, several calibration and setup steps must be completed for it to function correctly.\nJoystick/Gamepad Calibration\nSome joysticks require calibration before they can be enabled for use with QGroundControl. If a joystick requires calibration, the Joystick tab will be red, and these steps should be followed to calibrate the joystick. If the joystick does not require calibration, the Joystick tab will not be red, and this step can be skipped!\n\nGo to the Joystick page in the sidebar on the left.\nEnsure the 'TX Mode' selection is set to 3.\nClick on the \"Calibration\" tab, then click \"Next\".\nFollow the step-by-step instructions, move the sticks as indicated in the diagram in QGroundControl.\n\nWhen completed, the Joystick tab will no longer be red, and the Enabled checkbox on the Joystick page should be checked.\nButton Setup\nThe default button setup for ArduSub is as shown in the image below:\n\nThe button functions may be reconfigured in the Joystick page.\nSensor Calibration\n\nGo to the Sensors tab in the sidebar on the left.\nClick on the Accelerometers tab and follow the instructions.\nChoose Roll90 for the Autopilot Orientation selection.\nClick on Compass and follow the instructions.\nClick on Calibrate Pressure and wait for the calibration to complete.\n\nWhen completed, the Sensors tab will no longer be red.\n\nConfigure Motor Directions\nThe direction that the motors will spin depends on how the vehicle and motors were assembled, so each motor's forward/reverse direction must be configured in software.\nTo begin, navigate to the Motors tab in the sidebar on the left, then proceed with the automatic (recommended) or manual configuration.\n\nWarning Be sure to keep all body parts and clothing clear of thrusters while the vehicle is armed.\nWarning DO NOT run thrusters for longer than 30 seconds in air or you will wear out the plastic bearings.\n\nAutomatic Configuration\n\nAdjust the vehicle's buoyancy to be neutral or slightly positive.\nPlace the vehicle in water with enough room for it to move around slightly without bumping into walls or the bottom. Make sure the vehicle has a bit of slack in the tether so that it can move freely.\nGo to the Motors tab in the sidebar on the left.\nClick the Auto-Detect Directions button, and wait while the vehicle does it's motor direction detection routine.\nThe results of the routine will appear as the routine progresses, and success or failure will be indicated. If the routine failed, you may try again, or configure the motor directions manually.\n\n\nManual Configuration\n\nGo to the Motors tab in the sidebar on the left.\nRead and understand the instructions on the setup page.\nArm the vehicle by clicking the switch on the page.\nOne at a time, move each slider, and make sure that the motor that spins is pushing air as described in the instructions on the Motor Setup page. If a motor is spinning in the wrong direction, click the corresponding checkbox under the 'Reverse Motor Direction' section to correct the motor rotation.\nWhen you are finished with the setup, disarm the vehicle by clicking the switch.\n\n\nVoltage and Current Measurement Setup\nIn the Power tab , select Analog Voltage and Current and enter the values according to the manufacturers specifications.\nIf using a Blue Robotics Power Sense Module, select the “Blue Robotics Power Sense Module R2” profile for the Power Sensor.\n\nSOS Leak Sensor Setup\nIn the Safety tab, select the output channel that the leak detector in is plugged into, and set the Logic when dry to \"Low.\"\n\nSetup Low Voltage Failsafe\nOn the Safety tab set the battery failsafe to Warning and the desired voltage or capacity to trigger the alarm. Remember you will need some power to go back home.\n\n\nWarning Lithium Batteries should not be overdischarged, as it damages their internal chemistry. Do not let each cell's voltage get lower than 3.0 V.\n\nCamera Tilt Setup (if used)\n\nSelect the Camera tab. \nThe \"Gimbal Tilt\" settings are used for the camera tilt. \nChoose whichever channel the servo is plugged into for \"Output channel\". Valid output channels are any of the unused MAIN motor outputs (1-8), and AUX outputs 1-4 (9-12). \nSelect Servo for the \"Type\" under \"Gimbal Settings\" at the bottom.\n\n\nIf desired, you can check the Stabilize box, which will enable auto-stabilization of the camera based on the vehicle pitch angle. We generally leave this unchecked.\nLights Setup\n\nThe output channel for the lights is configured in the Lights tab. \nSelect the output channel that you have plugged your lights into, as shown below.\n\n\nInfo This setup only works with lights that are controllable with a servo PWM pulse, such as the Blue Robotics Lumen Lights.\n\n\nSD Card Formatting\nThe SD card inside of the autopilot (eg Pixhawk) is where ArduSub stores its dataflash logs. It should be formatted as a FAT/exFAT/FAT32 partition. If it gets corrupted or has a different filesystem, you should format it.\nThe following steps will help you format it:\n\n    \n    Windows\n    \n    \n    Mac\n    \n    -->\n    \n    Linux\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Open \"My Computer\" and find the drive for your SD card (it will only be name \"ArduSub\" if you named it so in a previous formatting). Right click it and choose \"Format\".\n\n  \n\n 2. This GUI will open. Here you can pick a name for the Volume (this will only show when connected via an SD card reader to your PC). Pick the \"exFAT\" option and then click Start.\n\n  \n\n 3. Verify all the information and click \"OK\":\n\n  \n\n 4. The SD card will be formatted. Once the formatting is finished, click \"OK\", eject the SD card, and insert it into the autopilot.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Open your file browser and find the SD card in the left bar. Right click it and chose \"format\".\n\n  \n\n 2. This GUI will open. Here you can pick a name for the Volume (this will only show when connected via an SD card reader to your PC). Pick the \"FAT\" option and then click Next.\n\n  \n\n 3. Verify all the information and click \"Format\":\n\n  \n\n 4. After it is done, eject the SD card, disconnect it from your computer, and insert it into the autopilot.\n\n  \n\n\n"},"quick-start/first-dive.html":{"url":"quick-start/first-dive.html","title":"First Dive","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Ready for Your First Dive\nBefore putting the vehicle in the water, there are a few things which will need to be checked.\nThe first dive should be in a body of water that is shallow, still, and clear. A pool or a test tank is recommended. Testing in a more controlled environment will provide a good opportunity to check that the vehicle is ballasted correctly. It will also confirm that the controller is set up correctly and vehicle is behaving as expected.\nConnecting Batteries/Power Supply\nTo get ready for your first dive, the vehicle will need to be powered.\nEither:\n\nPlug a fully charged battery into the vehicle's power distribution system, or\nTurn the power supply ON after reading and understanding the manufacturers instructions.\n\nSetting up Your Topside Control\nConnect the following to the Topside Computer:\n\nVehicle tether (through the appropriate interface, if used)\nJoystick\n\nController Functions\nThe ArduSub firmware comes with the button setup shown below as a default:\n\nButtons may be reassigned though the following steps:\n\nGo to Vehicle Setup View then select “Joystick”.\nThe “Button Assignment” tab shows what all the buttons are currently set to control.\nPress the button that you are interested in changing. The button number will light up.\nSelect what you would like the button to do from the dropdown to the right of the button number.\n\nDive Modes\n\nIn Manual Mode the vehicle will only output motor controls based on the pilot input from the joysticks. There is no feedback stabilization, heading holding, or depth holding.\nIn Stabilize Mode the vehicle will stabilize roll to level and it will maintain heading when not commanded to turn. The vertical control is left entirely to the pilot.\nIn Depth Hold Mode the vehicle will hold depth unless you command it to dive/ascend. It will also stabilize roll to level and maintain heading when not commanded to turn.\n\nPre-Dive Checklist\n\nPut the vehicle on the ground and make sure that people are clear of the thrusters.\nCheck to make sure the camera tilt function and lights work. If they do not, please see the Troubleshooting section.\nPut the vehicle in Manual Mode.\nArm the ROV.\nPress the forward/reverse stick forward to check that the vectored thrusters are spinning freely.\nPress the ascend/descend stick forward to check that the vertical thrusters are spinning freely.\nDisarm the ROV.\nLaunch.\n\nAll Launches\n\nDo not launch the vehicle near swimmers or divers.\nDo not release the vehicle prior to it touching the water. If necessary, use the tether to lower it down. When lowereing the vehicle, keep the dome away from any hard or sharp objects.\nDo not launch in water that is too shallow to freely drive the vehicle.\nKeep the vehicle away from boats that do not know that the vehicle is in the water.\nDo not arm until the vehicle is in the water and the launcher is clear of the vehicle.\n\nBoat Launch\n\nKeep the vehicle and tether clear of the boat’s propellers or jets.\nMake sure that the captain of the boat knows that the ROV is about to be launched.\n\nShore Launch\n\nDo not launch the vehicle in heavy surf.\nThe vehicle may need to be walked into the water to get to a point where the water is deep enough to drive the ROV.\n\nOperation\nTether Management\nWhen diving an ArduSub vehicle,  the tether will require some active management. Here are some guidelines for good tether management:\n\nKeep the tether away from propellers or jets if you are operating on a boat.\nKeep the tether and vehicle away from other boats that are not aware that it is in the water.\nKeep the tether away from sharp objects such as coral, rocks, etc.\nDo not deploy too much tether. Excess tether in the water will add drag to the vehicle and provide an opportunity for the tether to get caught on something.\nDo not deploy the tether over sharp edges or rough ground.\nDo not step on the tether.\n\nDriving Guidelines\n\nDo not drive into a sandy bottom. If you do drive into a sandy bottom, stop driving the vehicle and allow it to float up to prevent sand from getting into the vertical thrusters.\nDrive smoothly and on low gain when possible to maximize battery life.\nDo not touch coral with the ROV to prevent damage to the coral.\nAvoid driving into seaweed when possible. Seaweed can get sucked into and stop the thrusters from spinning.\nWhen diving, it is helpful to follow down a chain or a line to give a frame of reference.\n\nBattery Monitoring\n\nBe sure to occasionally glance at the battery voltage in the instrument panel.\nIt is recommended to recover the vehicle once the battery reaches 12.5V to avoid discharging below 12.0V, which can permanently damage a 4S battery or shorten its lifespan.\n\nRecovery\nDisarm the vehicle prior to attempting to recover it.\nPowered Recovery\nRecoveries will typically be when the vehicle is under power.\n\nThe pilot should find the tether and follow it back to the launching area.\nWhile the pilot is driving back pull in the tether slack. Clean debris off of the tether and inspect for cuts or nicks while pulling in.\nWhen the vehicle arrives back to the launching location, disarm it.\nPick up the vehicle directly if practical, or pull the it up using the tether. Avoid sharp or hard object while lifting by the tether; allow space for the vehicle to swing.\nDisconnect the battery or shut the power supply off.\n\nUnpowered Recovery\nIf the vehicle loses power or connection to QGroundControl while diving:\n\nPull the tether in at a moderate pace. Don’t try to pull it in as fast as possible.\n\n"},"reference/qgc-configuration.html":{"url":"reference/qgc-configuration.html","title":"QGroundControl","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQGroundControl Features and Configuration\nQGroundControl (QGC) is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ArduSub, which provides setup and control functionality. It is installed on the Topside Computer.\nQGC has been designed to configure and fly many different types of vehicles (copters, planes, rovers, boats, subs) and firmware types (ArduPilot and PX4).\n\nNote When an autopilot board with ArduSub firmware is connected, the default QGC interface changes to a customized one for ArduSub vehicles. A few pages on the Vehicle Setup View are different from other ArduPilot vehicle types and any setting or section labeled \"PX4 Only\" will not apply.\n\nThe QGroundControl User Guide is the official documentation for the project, however ArduSub vehicles introduce different settings and functions which are covered in more detail in this documentation. \nQuick Start\n\nDownload and install QGroundControl for your operating system.\nStart QGroundControl.\nTurn on and connect an ArduSub vehicle. If using a Companion Computer, the Network Settings will need to be configured.

The user can then select the desired button action from the dropdown.\n\nJoystick Button Functions\nJoystick buttons can be configured to perform different functions. Each button may be assigned a regular function and a shift function. To use shift functions, a button must be assigned the special shift function. The shift button will then act like a shift key on a keyboard; when held, it modifies the other buttons to execute their assigned shift functions. The available button functions are described below.\nGeneral\n\nnone: Do nothing, button is disabled\nshift: When held, act as a shift modifier for other buttons\narm_toggle: Toggle the armed state of the vehicle\narm: Arm the vehicle\ndisarm: Disarm the vehicle\ngain_toggle: Toggle between minimum and maximum pilot input gain sensitivity\ngain_inc: Increase pilot input gain/sensitivity\ngain_dec: Decrease pilot input gain/sensitivity\ntrim_roll_inc: Trim level target roll to the right\ntrim_roll_dec: Trim level target roll to the left\ntrim_pitch_inc: Trim level target pitch forward\ntrim_pitch_dec: Trim level target pitch backward\ninput_hold_toggle: Toggle holding current joystick axis inputs (cruise control on/off)\nroll_pitch_toggle: Toggle between roll/pitch and forward/lateral control on joystick input\n\nMode Selection\nThese button functions will command a switch to the corresponding flight mode. Please note that the advanced modes are in development and are not recommended for general use.\n Standard Modes \n\nmode_manual\nmode_stabilize\nmode_depth_hold\n\n Advanced Modes \n\nmode_poshold\nmode_auto\nmode_circle\nmode_guided\nmode_acro\n\nRoll and Pitch Control\nPresently (due to legacy/inheritance reasons), there is no convenient way to control the roll and pitch of and ArduSub vehicle with QGroundControl. The available solution is to use the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button function. When this button is pushed, the forward and lateral joystick axes toggle between controlling the forward and lateral motion of the vehicle and controlling the roll and pitch of the vehicle.\nThe roll and pitch input behaves differently in different flight modes.\n\nMANUAL: The roll and pitch input control the rotation rate of the vehicle. As long as the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will continue to rotate. A centered joystick input commands a rotation rate of zero.\nACRO: This functions like MANUAL, but the rate of rotation is precisely controlled and stabilized.\nSTABILIZE: The roll and pitch input control the desired angle of the vehicle attitude. When the joystick input is centered, the vehicle will stabilize a level attitude. When the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will stabilize the deflected angle. There are two parameters that control the maximum angle of vehicle deflection: the pilot input gain (which scales the input), and the ANGLE_MAX parameter (which controls the maximum angle that the vehicle will deflect in stabilize mode). For example, if the ANGLE_MAX parameter is 80 degrees, and the input gain is 50%, when the the roll or pitch joystick input is completely deflected, the vehicle will deflect 40 degrees ( 0.5 * 80 ). Press the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button while the vehicle is deflected to lock the current deflection angle and return to controlling forward and lateral motion. To clear the roll and pitch input command, switch to MANUAL mode, or press the roll_pitch_toggle button.\nDEPTH HOLD: This functions like STABILIZE mode, but the pressure-depth is also maintained. The throttle joystick is used to control the vehicle to the desired depth, and on joystick release the current depth will be stabilized to.\n\nCamera Control\n\nmount_center: Sets RC Input channel 8 pwm to the value configured by the CAM_TILT_CENTER parameter\nmount_tilt_up: Increase RC Input channel 8 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_CAM_TILT_STEP parameter\nmount_tilt_down: Decrease RC Input channel 8 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_CAM_TILT_STEP parameter\ncamera_trigger: Trigger cameras shutter NOT IMPLEMENTED\ncamera_source_toggle: Toggle video source, toggles RC Input channel 10 between 1100 and 1900 pwm\nmount_pan_right: Pan mount right\nmount_pan_left: Pan mount left\n\nLights Control\n\nlights1_cycle: Increase or decrease RC Input channel 9 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter, switches between increasing and increasing when output limits are reached\nlights1_brighter: Increase RC Input channel 9 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter\nlights1_dimmer: Decrease RC Input channel 9 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter\n\nlights2_cycle: Increase or decrease RC Input channel 10 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter, switches between increasing and increasing when output limits are reached\n\nlights2_brighter: Increase RC Input channel 10 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter\nlights2_dimmer: Decrease RC Input channel 10 pwm by the amount configured by the JS_LIGHTS_STEP parameter\n\nRelay Control\n\nrelay_1_on: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN parameter to output HIGH\nrelay_1_off: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN parameter to output LOW\nrelay_1_toggle: Toggles the state of the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN parameter\n\nrelay_2_on: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN2 parameter to output HIGH\n\nrelay_2_off: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN2 parameter to output LOW\nrelay_2_toggle: Toggles the state of the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN2 parameter\n\nrelay_3_on: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN3 parameter to output HIGH\n\nrelay_3_off: Sets the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN3 parameter to output LOW\nrelay_3_toggle: Toggles the state of the pin configured by the RELAY_PIN3 parameter\n\nServo Control\n\nservo_1_inc: Increase Aux1 servo output by 50 pwm\nservo_1_dec: Decrease Aux1 servo output by 50 pwm\nservo_1_min: Set Aux1 servo output to the configured minimum pwm according to SERVO9_MIN\nservo_1_max: Set Aux1 servo output to the configured maximum pwm according to SERVO9_MAX\nservo_1_center: Set Aux1 servo output to the configured center according to SERVO9_TRIM\n\nservo_2_inc: Increase Aux2 servo output by 50 pwm\n\nservo_2_dec: Decrease Aux2 servo output by 50 pwm\nservo_2_min: Set Aux2 servo output to the configured minimum pwm according to SERVO10_MIN\nservo_2_max: Set Aux2 servo output to the configured maximum pwm according to SERVO10_MAX\nservo_2_center: Set Aux2 servo output to the configured center according to SERVO10_TRIM\n\nservo_3_inc: Increase Aux3 servo output by 50 pwm\n\nservo_3_dec: Decrease Aux3 servo output by 50 pwm\nservo_3_min: Set Aux3 servo output to the configured minimum pwm according to SERVO11_MIN\nservo_3_max: Set Aux3 servo output to the configured maximum pwm according to SERVO11_MAX\nservo_3_center: Set Aux3 servo output to the configured center according to SERVO11_TRIM\n\nCustom\nThese are reserved for developer use, and do not do anything by default\n\ncustom_1\ncustom_2\ncustom_3\ncustom_4\ncustom_5\ncustom_6\n\nFor more information, it's possible to check the ArduSub joystick source code.\nCalibration\nThis tab calibrates the joysticks control axis for recognition as proper inputs for QGC.\nThe calibration process wil only recognize 4 axis (0-3) even if there are more on the physical joystick.\n\nCalibration Procedures\n\nPress the Start button and then follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate/move the sticks.\nThe joystick is enabled as the last step of the calibration process.\nTest the buttons and sticks work as intended by pressing them, and viewing the result in the Axis/Button monitor in the General tab.\n\nAdvanced Settings\nSome additional options are available in this tab. These options may be useful for specific, unsual setups, for increasing sensibility, and for handling noisy joysticks.\nSome options are not required or useful with ArduSub and may inhibit proper operation if used.\n\nThrottle Options\n\nFull down stick is zero throttle: In this mode, lowered stick sends 0 in MANUAL_CONTROL z, centered stick 500, and raised 1000.\nCenter stick is zero throttle: Centered or lowered stick sends 0 in MANUAL_CONTROL z, raised stick sends 1000.\nSpring loaded throttle smoothing: In this mode you control not the throttle itself, but the rate at which it increases/decreases. This is useful for setups where the throttle stick is spring loaded, as the user can hold the desired throttle while releasing the stick.\n\n\n\nExponential Slider\nThe exponential slider allows you to make the sticks less sensitive in the center, allowing finer control in this zone. The slider adjusts the curvature of the exponential curve. The higher the Expo value, the flatter the curve is at the center, and steeper it is at the edges.\nFurther Advanced Settings\nThe advanced settings are not recommended for everyday users. They can cause unpredicted results if used incorrectly.\n"},"reference/ardusub/sensors-setup-page.html":{"url":"reference/ardusub/sensors-setup-page.html","title":"Sensors Setup Page","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensors Setup Page\nThe Sensors Setup page allows users to calibrate the vehicle's accelerometer, compass, pressure sensor.\nAvailable sensors are displayed as a list of buttons beside the sidebar.

The button number will light up.\nSelect what you would like the button to do from the dropdown to the right of the button number.\n\nFlight Modes\n\nIn Manual Mode the vehicle will only output motor controls based on the pilot input from the joysticks. There is no feedback stabilization, heading holding, or depth holding.\nIn Stabilize Mode the vehicle will stabilize roll to level and it will maintain heading when not commanded to turn. The vertical control is left entirely to the pilot.\nIn Depth Hold Mode the vehicle will hold depth unless you command it to dive/ascend. It will also stabilize roll to level and maintain heading when not commanded to turn.\n\nPilot Input Gain\nThe Pilot Input Gain controls how much power is available for thruster control.\nGain settings can be adjusted through the JS_GAIN parameter settings.\nPitch/Roll Control\nPresently (due to legacy/inheritance reasons), there is no convenient way to control the roll and pitch of and ArduSub vehicle with QGroundControl. The available solution is to use the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button function. When this button is pushed, the forward and lateral joystick axes toggle between controlling the forward and lateral motion of the vehicle and controlling the roll and pitch of the vehicle.\nThe roll and pitch input behaves differently in different flight modes.\n\nMANUAL: The roll and pitch input control the rotation rate of the vehicle. As long as the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will continue to rotate. A centered joystick input commands a rotation rate of zero.\nACRO: This functions like MANUAL, but the rate of rotation is precisely controlled and stabilized.\nSTABILIZE: The roll and pitch input control the desired angle of the vehicle attitude. When the joystick input is centered, the vehicle will stabilize a level attitude. When the joystick input is deflected, the vehicle will stabilize the deflected angle. There are two parameters that control the maximum angle of vehicle deflection: the pilot input gain (which scales the input), and the ANGLE_MAX parameter (which controls the maximum angle that the vehicle will deflect in stabilize mode). For example, if the ANGLE_MAX parameter is 80 degrees, and the input gain is 50%, when the the roll or pitch joystick input is completely deflected, the vehicle will deflect 40 degrees ( 0.5 * 80 ). Press the roll_pitch_toggle joystick button while the vehicle is deflected to lock the current deflection angle and return to controlling forward and lateral motion. To clear the roll and pitch input command, switch to MANUAL mode, or press the roll_pitch_toggle button.\nDEPTH HOLD: This functions like STABILIZE mode, but the pressure-depth is also maintained. The throttle joystick is used to control the vehicle to the desired depth, and on joystick release the current depth will be stabilized to.\n\n"},"reference/companion-web-ui.html":{"url":"reference/companion-web-ui.html","title":"Companion Web Interface","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanion Web Interface\nThe Companion computer(Install instructions) hosts a useful web-interface with different pages for accessing parameters and functionalities associated with Companion.

It can be used to create one-to-one, and one-to-many connections. The configuration on this page is persistent and loaded at boot. The configuration is stored in the file ~/routing.conf.\n\nNote This program is written in python and is not optimized or well-suited for high-bandwidth applications. The maximum recommended baudrate is 115200. If high bandwidth routing is required, standard linux tools like tty, socat and netcat should be used instead.\n\n\nTo use the companion routing tool:\n\ncreate one or more endpoints with your desired configuration\nadd connections between the endpoints as you want\nremove connections by clicking the 'broken link' button next to the configuration\nremove endpoints by clicking the 'trash can' button next to the configuration\n\n\nEndpoints\nAn endpoint can be a serial port or a network port. Create an endpoint by entering the desired port settings, and click 'create link'.\nSerial Endpoints\nSelect one of the available serial ports from the drop down list, and choose the baudrate to use. The serial port must not be in use by another program! Click 'Add Serial Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.\n\nUDP Endpoints\nEnter the ip address and UDP port to use. If the ip address is '0.0.0.0', it will bind the local port as a server. All other ip addresses will result in a client connection. Click 'Add UDP Endpoint' to create the communication endpoint.\n\nRoutes\nEndpoints can be connected bidirectionally (typical), or with a one way connection. To begin routing communications between endpoints, choose the endpoints that you wish to connect, the direction to route communications, and click 'connect'.\n\nExample configurations\nTopside as UDP Server\nTo bridge serial communications between a device connected to the companion computer inside the ROV, and the existing network connection to the topside computer:\n\nCreate a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate\nCreate a UDP endpoint using the topside computer IP address 192.168.2.1, and the port that the topside application will bind.\nConnect them bidirectionally\nThe application on the topside computer should bind the UDP port as a server\n\nTo test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with \"netcat\" on the topside computer: nc -ulp \n\nNote Topside as UDP Server mode is not recommended for master-slave setups. For the connection to be properly stabilished, the serial device must send some data. Only then the connection is stabilished and the topside is able to send data to the companion.\n\nThis python script exemplifies how to run an UDP server with Python:\n\"\"\"\nCompanion routing UDP server example.\n\nThis script Binds to an UDP port and receives data from the Companion at\na given port.\nYou should run this at your topside computer.\n\"\"\"\nimport socket\n\nUDP_IP = \"192.168.2.1\" # Topside (local) IP\nUDP_PORT = 5555        # Topside (local) port to listen on\n\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, # Internet\n                    socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # UDP\nsock.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))\n\nwhile True:\n    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(1024) # Buffer size is 1024 bytes\n    print(data.decode())\n\nCompanion as UDP Server\n\nCreate a serial endpoint corresponding to the attached serial device and the desired serial baudrate\nCreate a UDP endpoint using the 0.0.0.0 IP address, and the port that the server will bind to.\nConnect them bidirectionally\nThe application on the topside computer should connect to 192.168.2.2 at the port chosen in step two\n\nTo test the connection on a linux machine, bind to the port with \"netcat\" on the topside computer: nc -u 192.168.2.2 \nThis Python example shows how to communicate using these UDP ports:\n\"\"\"\nCompanion routing UDP client example.\n\nThis script connects to a endpoint at the Companion exposed using the IP 0.0.0.0\nand a given port.

no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging\nThere are two types of logs that can be used to diagnose problems while running ArduSub, or to retrieve data for post-processing.\nTelemetry logs\nGround Control Station (GCS) software will store all of the autopilot telemtry in a log. These telemetry logs contain all of the MAVLink messages received in their binary format. MAVProxy and QGroundControl save telemetry logs locally in a .tlog file. Telemetry logs are the preferred way of diagnosing most problems.\nOnce connected to the autopilot, MAVProxy will save all telemetry to a file called 'mav.tlog'. The mav.tlog file is saved under the same path from which MAVProxy was run. By default, QGroundControl only begins logging telemetry after the vehicle has been armed. QGroundControl can be configured to log telemetry while the autopilot is disarmed in the General tab of the Application Settings menu (click the purple 'Q' icon in the menu bar). Select the option to save logs 'even if vehicle was not armed' in order to log telemetry while disarmed. QGroundControl saves the telemetry logs in the 'Telemetry' directory under the 'Save Path' that is specified in the General tab of the Vehicle Seup menu.\n\nDataFlash logs\nDataFlash logs are saved by the Autopilot directly to on-board memory (SD card in the case of the Pixhawk), regardless of a telemetry connection. These logs are saved in a .bin file. DataFlash logs are capable of logging data at a much faster rate than telemetry logs. The DataFlash logs are named and saved in ascending order. If GPS is available, the logs will be dated according to the GPS timestamp. DataFlash log files can be opened and inspected with MAVProxy, APM Planner 2 or Mission Planner.\nBy default, a new dataflah log file is created when the vehicle is initially armed, and logging is performed only while the vehicle is armed. The LOG_DISARMED parameter can be set to 'Enabled' in order to begin a DataFlash log as soon as the autopilot is booted, even before arming. With LOG_DISARMED enabled, logging will be performed whether the vehicle is armed or disarmed, until the vehicle is powered down.\n\nDownloading\nDataFlash logs can be retrieved in two ways:\n\nRemove the Micro SD card from the Pixhawk and plug it into your computer to view and transfer the logs using a file explorer like a regular USB drive.\n\nDownload the logs remotely via QGroundControl or MAVProxy.\n\nLog downloading via QGroundControl\n  Click the Analyze icon at the top of the window. The icon looks like a magnifying glass over a document.\n  Click the 'Refresh' button to view available logs.\n  Select the log you would like to download, and click 'Download'.\n  Multiple logs can be downloaded by highlighting the desired logs before clicking 'Download'.\n  \n\nLog downloading via MAVProxy\n  While connected to the autopilot via MAVProxy, type 'log list' in the MAVProxy console to list the available DataFlash logs onboard the autopilot.\n  Type 'log download X' to download log number X\n  While the log is downloading, you can type 'log status' to view the status of the download, or 'log cancel' to cancel the download.\n\n\n\n\nLog Analysis\nTelemetry logs and dataflash logs are stored in different formats, and contain different (but in many cases overlapping) data. The log entries for telemetry logs are the MAVLink messages that are documented here and here. The log entries in dataflash logs are self-documented in their binary format, but the formats can also be determined by looking at the code here.\nBelow is a brief description of some tools that are available for viewing and extracting data from logs.\nMAVExplorer.py\nMAVExplorer is a command line/graphical tool used to plot log data. MAVExplorer supports both telemetry logs and dataflash logs, and is included as part of a MAVProxy installation. Please refer to the MAVExplorer documentation for more information. Note, the log file name should not contain any spaces when using this tool\nmavlogdump.py\nmavlogdump.py is a command line tool used to filter and export log data to plain-text files like .csv or .json. mavlogdump.py supports both telemetry logs and dataflash logs, and it is just one of many such log analysis tools included as part of a pymavlink installation (also installed with MAVProxy). Note, the log file name should not contain any spaces when using this tool\nTo install mavlogdump.py, install pymavlink from pip:\npip install pymavlink\nTo use mavlogdump.py, refer to the output of mavlogdump.py --help:\nusage: mavlogdump.py [-h] [--no-timestamps] [--planner] [--robust] [-f]\n                     [--condition CONDITION] [-q] [-o OUTPUT] [-p]\n                     [--format FORMAT] [--csv_sep CSV_SEP] [--types TYPES]\n                     [--nottypes NOTTYPES] [--dialect DIALECT]\n                     [--zero-time-base] [--no-bad-data] [--show-source]\n                     [--show-seq] [--source-system SOURCE_SYSTEM]\n                     [--source-component SOURCE_COMPONENT] [--link LINK]\n                     LOG\n\nexample program that dumps a Mavlink log file.

See the Mission Planner log analysis documentation for more details.\n"},"reference/troubleshooting.html":{"url":"reference/troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nThis page shares issues that users have run into and how they were resolved. Hopefully this will help to solves issues for others.\nVehicle Control\nVehicle has telemetry but does not respond to joystick\nMake sure you followed the instructions in Joystick/Gamepad Calibration and that the \"Enable joystick input\" checkbox is checked.\nVehicle flips itself over\nCheck that the motor directions are configured correctly. Also check that the motors are connected to the correct motor outputs on the flight controller, according to the supported frame diagrams.\nVehicle turns or moves even when not controlled to do so.\nPlease check RCx_TRIM parameters to make sure that all trims are set to 1500, with the exception of RC3_TRIM, which should be set to 1100.\nMotors spin as soon as the vehicle is armed.\nMake sure that the vehicle is in Manual mode.\nThe flight controller attempts to stabilize the vehicle's attitude so that it is perfectly level. If the vehicle's attitude is off from level, even a fraction of a degree, the flight controller will spin the motors in an attempt to correct the error. If the vehicle is sitting on land, the error will not change, and the flight controller will spin the motors faster and faster as it tries harder and harder to correct the error. Testing the vehicle on land should be done in MANUAL mode, which just passes pilot inputs to the motors with no stabilization.\nNo Telemetry / \"Waiting for Vehicle Connection\" (No Autopilot Connection)\nVerify Network Configuration\nVerify that your network settings are correct. Verify your network configuration by entering the command ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Mac/Linux) on the surface computer command line. The output should show that your Ethernet IP address is 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.\nCarefully double check that you have entered these numbers correctly. The Ethernet IP address should be exactly 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask should be exactly 255.255.255.0.\nYou should be able to ping the companion computer from the surface computer. On the surface computer's command line enter:\nping 192.168.2.2\nIf you do not get a ping response, then something is wrong with the network communication between the surface computer and the companion computer. You may have to adjust your firewall and/or antivirus settings to allow QGrouncControl access to the network.\nFirewall and Antivirus\nAntivirus and firewall software can block the incomming connection from the ROV. Make an exception/rule to allow inbound and outbound traffic on UDP ports 5600 and 14550, or turn off your antivirus and firewall software.\nCabling\nTry replacing your Ethernet cable. Sometimes the wires inside a cable break, and the cable stops working.\nReboot Computer\nIf you are using Windows, sometimes the computer needs to be rebooted for network settings to take affect.\nVerify QGC Autoconnect settings\nMake sure that the QGroundControl is configured to automatically connect to UDP and USB links. Click on the 'Q' icon in the upper left to view the Application Settings. Click on the 'General Settings' tab. In the options for 'Autoconnect to:', make sure the UDP option is checked.\n\nVerify Autopilot USB Connection\nCheck if the Autopilot is connected with following steps:\n\nNavigate to the system page in the Companion web interface\nCheck the list of detected serial devices for an entry that says Pixhawk Autopilot\nIf you do not see an entry that says Pixhawk Autopilot, check the autopilot connection with the Companion computer.\n\nYou can test the autopilot and the usb cable by connecting the autopilot directly to your surface computer and checking the connection with QGroundControl.\nIf you cannot connect to the autopilot:\nTry using a different usb cable. Make sure that the USB cable has data lines, some USB cables only provide power and will not allow communication. You can connect the Pixhawk to the surface computer directly with the USB cable to verify that the USB cable works.\nTry connecting the autopilot to a different usb port\nTry replacing the autopilot\n\n\n\n\nIf you see an entry in the detected serial devices list that says Pixhawk Autopilot (bootloader), you must flash the autopilot with ArduSub firmware. Click the 'Restore Default Firmware' button on the system page, and wait for the text on the bottom of the page to indicate that the process is complete.\n\n\nIf you do not see the system web page, make sure the companion computer is powered on with a supply that is capable of delivering at least 2A. Check the activity lights on the Raspberry Pi Ethernet Jack. The lights should be on or blinking. If the lights are not on, make sure that you are using a network patch cable, not a crossover cable. Look closely at the color of the wires inside connectors on either end of the network cable, the order of the wires should be the same on both ends of the cable. If everything appears ok with the companion computer and the physical network connection, check your network settings (below).\nCheck MAVProxy\nIf your network is configured correctly, but you still have no telemetry, we need to make sure that MAVProxy is running on the companion computer and that the autopilot and MAVProxy are communicating.\nTo verify that MAVProxy is running, visit the system page in the companion web interface, and look for the mavproxy entry under the list of active services.\nTo verify that MAVProxy and the autopilot are communicating, log into the Companion computer via the web terminal, ssh, or PuTTY (user: pi, password: companion), and enter the command:\nscreen -r mavproxy\nIf Mavproxy and the autopilot are working correctly, the output should contain something like this:\nAPM: ArduSub V3.4 (422c10cf)\nAPM: PX4: 96a4c296 NuttX: 580f5354\nAPM: Frame: ROV_VECTORED_FRAME\nAPM: PX4v2 0048003B 3135510C 35333436\nReceived 608 parameters\nSaved 608 parameters to mav.parm\nTo return to the command line and keep the mavproxy process running, hit control+a then type 'd' (to detach).\nIf you still do not have telemetry after all of these steps, please reboot the surface computer and the companion computer, and try again. If it is still not working after rebooting, please leave a comment on discuss.bluerobotics.com with notes on your results of all of the above troubleshooting steps.\nReset MavProxy Options\nSome updates require changes to the MavProxy options. To avoid overwriting user changes, those do not apply until you Restore Default Options. Navigate to MavProxy page and click Restore Default Options. This will erase the current options, revert to the default for the current companion version, and reset the MavProxy service.\nNo Video\nIf you do not have telemetry, please troubleshoot that first according to the above instructions.\nBegin by verifying that your network settings are correct, your Ethernet IP address should be 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0.\nIf you have telemetry, but no video, make sure the video settings are correct in QGroundControl. The video settings are found in the General tab of the Application Settings (Q icon) view. The video source should be set to UDP video, and the port should be 5600. These are the default settings. If you change these settings, you will need to close and re-launch QGroundControl.\n\nIf you are using Linux, you must install a few dependencies for the video to work:\napt install gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly\nVerify that your camera is detected by seeing it listed under the detected video devices section on the Companion system webpage. If your camera is not detected, make sure that the camera supports H.264 video output, and make sure the cable is well-seated, or try another camera cable.\nVerify that the video streaming service is active; it should be listed under the active services on the Companion system webpage.\nIf you are using a Windows computer:\n\nDisable/re-enable the network interface\nReboot\nQGC installs three shortcuts: QGC, QGC (GPU Safe Mode), and QGC (GPU Compatibility Mode). Try launching QGC with each of these shortcuts\n\nPoor video streaming performance\nThe video stream should have about 200ms delay, just barely noticeable. There are many factors that could cause lag, low framerate, and pixelation/tearing in the video.\nHere are some tips for troubleshooting poor video performance:\nIn general:\n\nBandwidth - Test the bandwidth at 192.168.2.2:2770/network. The maximum theoretical bandwidth on a Raspberry Pi 3 is 100Mbps, if the bandwidth tests achieve greater than 70Mbps, it is a very good connection. Systems with bandwidths below 15Mbps should be diagnosed for issues.\nTry another cable - Not all cables are created equal; some are really junk.\nUpdate Software - Use the latest software to make sure you are getting the best performance.\nCompanion  computer  power supply - Most companion computers require a power supply capable of providing 5V at 2A. Smaller/weaker power supplies can severely affect performance of the companion computer.\nTether interface power supply - If you are using a tether interface board, make sure it has a solid power supply. Some laptop USB ports cannot provide enough power for the tether interface board to perform optimally. Try using a portable USB battery charger.\nTether interface connections - Make sure that all connections are well-seated and tight.\nSystem resources - Open the system resource monitor and look at how much CPU and RAM your computer is using. Try closing other programs like anti-virus and screen recorders to make more system resources available to programs used to operate the vehicle.\nResolution - Modify the video stream Frame Size at 192.168.2.2:2770/camera. Change it to a value equal to or less than the resolution of your display.\n\nIf you are using a Raspberry Pi camera:\n\nDelete the '--intra 1' setting at 192.168.2.2:2770/camera and restart the camera.\nUpdate the companion computer software at 192.168.2.2:2770/system.\n\nIf you are using a Windows computer:\n\nUpgrade to Windows 10!\nTry these three suggestions by Bo Koppel:\n\nWhen using original power supply that supply laptop (but not charge at the same time) there is something probably in BIOS that slow down graphic card to save energy. That makes processor do some of the graphics calculations. (And actually consume even more energy!)\nSolution: Go on battery or use a large powersupply (in our case 120W)\nHow to quick check if this is the problem: pull out powersupply, if this is the case, latency disappear in two seconds.\n\nNvidia powerful graphic cards use an engine called PhysX for games etc. It seams QGC does not use that.\nAlso QGC works default on motherboard graphic card, not on the more powerful Nvidia extension card.\nSolution: In Nvidias “control panel” select under “Programs” QGC so Nvidia forces QGC to use Nvidia card.\nSome graphic cards also needs tweeking in Nvidia 3D setup (same place as above line)\n\nReal crazy in a few computers: Switch system fonts from 125% size to 100%\n(Right click desktop, “adjust screen” then “monitor” translated from Swedish OS)\nCheck the 100% tickbox instead of 125%\nLog out and log in again, fixed….\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nCamera does not tilt\nThe output servo rail on the Pixhawk requires a separate 5V power supply. The power module and USB power inputs on the Pixhawk will not power the servo rail. Make sure you have a 5V input on the servo rail via an ESC BEC or standalone BEC.\nCheck that input/output channels are configured for camera tilt.\nCheck that joystick buttons have been assigned to camera tilt functions.\n\"No io thread heartbeat\" message constantly appears.\nThis message indicates that the APM io thread has stopped running. The most likely cause is a corrupted filesystem on the micro SD card. Remove the card from the pixhawk, and format it as FAT32. If the error persists, you will need to replace the SD card, or disable dataflash log files by setting the LOG_BACKEND_TYPE parameter to None (0).\nCompass heading drifts while the vehicle is stationary\nThe compass inside of the ROV is very sensitive and will be affected by large iron/steel structures, including rebar in concrete. You will get the best compass calibration outside, away from large structures and concrete. It is possible to calibrate inside, you may need to increase the value of the COMPASS_OFS_MAX parameter before you get a passing calibration. Note that the compass will always be affected by ferrous structures because they distort Earth's magnetic field, however the heading should remain stationary (maybe incorrect) while the vehicle is stationary in any case.\nPerform these steps to recalibrate the compass:\n\nPower on the vehicle and wait 10 minutes to ensure the sensors are warmed up.\nMake sure that the INS_GYR_CAL parameter value is set to 'Never'.\nPerform an accelerometer calibration.\nPerform a compass calibration.\nReboot the vehicle. The compass should be still.\n\nIssue Reporting\nWe're always trying to make our documentation, instructions, software, and user experience better.

RC Input is an array of control channels representing pilot inputs like forward and yaw commands. RC Output is an array of channels representing the pulse widths to write to individual servo output pins. Although ArduSub does not support the use of RC receivers, the logic is the same and is applied to joystick inputs instead. Joystick input and RC Input are synonymous in ArduSub.\nRC Inputs\nThese are the default channel mappings for RC input:\n\n\n\nChannel\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nPitch\n\n\n2\nRoll\n\n\n3\nThrottle\n\n\n4\nYaw\n\n\n5\nForward\n\n\n6\nLateral\n\n\n7\nCamera Pan\n\n\n8\nCamera Tilt*\n\n\n9\nLights 1 Level\n\n\n10\nLights 2 Level\n\n\n11\nVideo Switch\n\n\n\n*Note: RC Input Camera Tilt control is not standard servo-style control. Specifying a 'PWM' value sets the speed for a sweep from the current tilt angle to the min/max camera angle. The input difference from the midpoint (1500) sets the speed, e.g. a 1900 input sweeps to the max camera angle twice as fast as 1700.\nRC Outputs\nOn the Pixhawk, there are 8 main outputs and 6 auxiliary outputs. The main outputs are updated at 200Hz by default (configured via the RC_SPEED parameter), and the auxiliary outputs are always updated at 50Hz. It is important not to connect analog servos to the main outputs, because the very fast update rate can cause the servo to burn itself out.\n\n\n\nPixhawk Label\nServo Channel\n\n\n\n\nMain 1\n1\n\n\nMain 2\n2\n\n\nMain 3\n3\n\n\nMain 4\n4\n\n\nMain 5\n5\n\n\nMain 6\n6\n\n\nMain 7\n7\n\n\nMain 8\n8\n\n\nAux 1\n9\n\n\nAux 2\n10\n\n\nAux 3\n11\n\n\nAux 4\n12\n\n\nAux 5\n13\n\n\nAux 6\n14\n\n\n\nThe Pixhawk 6 'auxiliary' outputs can be configured as either general purpose input/output or PWM output.\nBy default, aux outputs 5 and 6 (SERVO13 and SERVO14) are reserved as GPIO pins to be used for relays, and will not output a pwm signal for other functions. This is configured with the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter at boot, which determines how many of the auxiliary outputs to configure as PWM outputs (default is 4).\n\n\n\nBRD_PWM_COUNT   Aux pin configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n0\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n2\nPWM\nPWM\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n(default) 4\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nGPIO\nGPIO\n\n\n6\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\nPWM\n\n\n\nControlling Servos\nAn output must be configured as PWM via the BRD_PWM_COUNT parameter to operate a servo.\nThe servos can be operated via the mavlink command DO_SET_SERVO. This command can be used to set the output of any servo channel that is not configured as a motor output. This command can conflict with other functions operating on the servo channel like pan/tilt mounts or lights. In order to avoid conflicts, the corresponding SERVOn_FUNCTION parameter should be set to Disabled (0).\nUp to three servos can also be operated via joystick button functions. The joystick button functions for *_servo_n will control the output on the Aux n pin (these cannot be remapped like the relay outputs).\n\n\n\nJoystick button function\nAux channel operated\n\n\n\n\nservo_1\nAux 1\n\n\nservo_2\nAux 2\n\n\nservo_3\nAux 3\n\n\n\nControlling Relays\nArduSub supports control of up to 4 relays.

This is a bitmask of checks that will be performed before allowing arming. The default is no checks, allowing arming at any time. You can select whatever checks you prefer by adding together the values of each check type to set this parameter. For example, to only allow arming when you have GPS lock and no RC failsafe you would set ARMING_CHECK to 72. For most users it is recommended that you set this to 1 to enable all checks.\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nNone\n\n\n1\nAll\n\n\n2\nBarometer\n\n\n4\nCompass\n\n\n8\nGPS Lock\n\n\n16\nINS(INertial Sensors - accels & gyros)\n\n\n32\nParameters(unused)\n\n\n64\nRC Channels\n\n\n128\nBoard voltage\n\n\n256\nBattery Level\n\n\n512\nAirspeed\n\n\n1024\nLoggingAvailable\n\n\n2048\nHardware safety switch\n\n\n4096\nGPS configuration\n\n\n8192\nSystem\n\n\n\n\nBitmask: 0:All,1:Barometer,2:Compass,3:GPS lock,4:INS,5:Parameters,6:RC Channels,7:Board voltage,8:Battery Level,9:Airspeed,10:Logging Available,11:Hardware safety switch,12:GPS Configuration,13:System,14:Mission,15:Rangefinder\n\nATC Parameters\nATC_SLEW_YAW: Yaw target slew rate\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nMaximum rate the yaw target can be updated in Loiter, RTL, Auto flight modes\n\nUnits: cdeg/s\n\nRange: 500 18000\n\nIncrement: 100\n\n\nATC_ACCEL_Y_MAX: Acceleration Max for Yaw\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nMaximum acceleration in yaw axis\n\nUnits: cdeg/s/s\n\nRange: 0 72000\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nDisabled\n\n\n9000\nVerySlow\n\n\n18000\nSlow\n\n\n36000\nMedium\n\n\n54000\nFast\n\n\n\n\nIncrement: 1000\n\nATC_RATE_FF_ENAB: Rate Feedforward Enable\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nControls whether body-frame rate feedfoward is enabled or disabled\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nDisabled\n\n\n1\nEnabled\n\n\n\nATC_ACCEL_R_MAX: Acceleration Max for Roll\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nMaximum acceleration in roll axis\n\nUnits: cdeg/s/s\n\nRange: 0 180000\n\nIncrement: 1000\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nDisabled\n\n\n30000\nVerySlow\n\n\n72000\nSlow\n\n\n108000\nMedium\n\n\n162000\nFast\n\n\n\nATC_ACCEL_P_MAX: Acceleration Max for Pitch\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nMaximum acceleration in pitch axis\n\nUnits: cdeg/s/s\n\nRange: 0 180000\n\nIncrement: 1000\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nDisabled\n\n\n30000\nVerySlow\n\n\n72000\nSlow\n\n\n108000\nMedium\n\n\n162000\nFast\n\n\n\nATC_ANGLE_BOOST: Angle Boost\nNote: This parameter is for advanced users\nAngle Boost increases output throttle as the vehicle leans to reduce loss of altitude\n\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n0\nDisabled\n\n\n1\nEnabled\n\n\n\nATC_ANG_RLL_P: Roll axis angle controller P gain\nRoll axis angle controller P gain.

information.\nRecommendation\nOpenCV support both Python 2 and Python 3, it's recommended to install it via your package manager.\nInstallation\nUbuntu 20.04\n# Update list of available packages\nsudo apt update\n\n# Install opencv and dependencies\nsudo apt install python3-numpy python3-opencv libopencv-dev\n\n# Install gstreamer and plugins\nsudo apt install python3-gst-1.0

to gstreamer that send it via udp (:5600) inside the companion board to the topside computer.\nTop side computer\nTo capture video stream with the python script and QGC at same time, it's necessary to modify gstreamer options, changing ! udpsink host=192.168.2.1 port=5600 to ! multiudpsink clients=192.168.2.1:5600,192.168.2.1:4777 and add the new port parameter when calling Video (video =

Otherwise, the autopilot will execute a failsafe if it has not received an updated command after a timeout period.\nInstallation\nUbuntu 20.04\n# Update list of available packages\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt -y upgrade\n\n# Install some dependencies\nsudo apt install -y python3-pip\n\n# Install mavproxy module and everything else needed\npip3 install mavproxy\n\nMac/Windows\nWith Python and pip installed, run pip install wheel mavproxy.\nTest installation\nYou can test your installation with python interactive shell.\npython\nimport pymavlink\nprint(pymavlink.__doc__)\n\nOutput:\nPython MAVLink library - see http://www.qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/mavproxy_startpage\n\nNote that pymavlink.__doc__ will show some information about the package.\nThis is a record of this example running in python interactive shell:\n\nExamples\nPymavlink has 3 types of messages:\n\ncommand_long_send: To create a raw package\n_send: To send simple mavlink messages\nmavutil: Functions to abstract some MAVLink messages\n\nConnect\nThere are 3 types of udp connections for mavlink_connection:\n\nudpout: Outputs data to a specified address:port (client).\nudpbcast: Broadcasts and locks to the first client to respond (does not handle multiple clients properly)\nUsing the IP 192.168.1.255 all devices from  192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255 will receive the data.\n\n\nudpin: Binds to a specific port in address:port (server), it's necessary to receive data from clients (udpout) before starting to send any data.\nudp: Exists for legacy reasons, works as udpin.\n\nShortcut Links\n\nAutopilot connected to the computer via serial\nRun pyMavlink on the surface computer\nRun pyMavlink on the companion computer\nSend Message to QGroundControl\nArm/Disarm the vehicle\nChange flight mode\nSend RC (Joystick)\nSend Manual Control\nRead all parameters\nRead and write parameters\nReceive data and filter by message type\nRequest message interval\nControl Camera Gimbal\nSet Servo PWM\nAdvanced Servo/Gripper Example\nSet Target Depth/Attitude\nSend GPS position\nSend rangefinder/computer vision distance measurement to the autopilot\n\nAutopilot (E.g: Pixhawk) connected to the computer via serial\n\"\"\"\nExample of connecting to an autopilot via serial communication using pymavlink\n\"\"\"\n\n# Import mavutil\nfrom pymavlink import mavutil\n\n# Create the connection\n# Need to provide the serial port and baudrate\nmaster = mavutil.mavlink_connection(\"/dev/ttyACM0\", baud=115200)\n\n# Restart the ArduSub board !\nmaster.reboot_autopilot()\n\nRun pyMavlink on the surface computer\n\"\"\"\nExample of how to connect pymavlink to an autopilot via an UDP connection\n\"\"\"\n\n# Disable \"Bare exception\" warning\n# pylint: disable=W0702\n\nimport time\n# Import mavutil\nfrom pymavlink import mavutil\n\n# Create the connection\n#  If using a companion computer\n#  the default connection is available\n#  at ip 192.168.2.1 and the port 14550\n# Note: The connection is done with 'udpin' and not 'udpout'.\n#  You can check in http:192.168.2.2:2770/mavproxy that the communication made for 14550\n#  uses a 'udpbcast' (client) and not 'udpin' (server).\n#  If you want to use QGroundControl in parallel with your python script,\n#  it's possible to add a new output port in http:192.168.2.2:2770/mavproxy as a new line.\n#  E.g: --out udpbcast:192.168.2.255:yourport\nmaster = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpin:0.0.0.0:14550')\n\n# Make sure the connection is valid\nmaster.wait_heartbeat()\n\n# Get some information !\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        print(master.recv_match().to_dict())\n    except:\n        pass\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n\n# Output:\n# {'mavpackettype': 'AHRS2', 'roll': -0.11364290863275528, 'pitch': -0.02841472253203392, 'yaw': 2.0993032455444336, 'altitude': 0.0, 'lat': 0, 'lng': 0}\n# {'mavpackettype': 'AHRS3', 'roll': 0.025831475853919983, 'pitch': 0.006112074479460716, 'yaw': 2.1514968872070312, 'altitude': 0.0, 'lat': 0, 'lng': 0, 'v1': 0.0, 'v2': 0.0, 'v3': 0.0, 'v4': 0.0}\n# {'mavpackettype': 'VFR_HUD', 'airspeed': 0.0, 'groundspeed': 0.0, 'heading': 123, 'throttle': 0, 'alt': 3.129999876022339, 'climb': 3.2699999809265137}\n# {'mavpackettype': 'AHRS', 'omegaIx': 0.0014122836291790009, 'omegaIy': -0.022567369043827057, 'omegaIz': 0.02394154854118824, 'accel_weight': 0.0, 'renorm_val': 0.0, 'error_rp': 0.08894175291061401, 'error_yaw': 0.0990816056728363}\n\nRun pyMavlink on the companion computer\n\"\"\"\nExample of how to connect to the autopilot by using mavproxy's\n--udpin:0.0.0.0:9000 endpoint from the companion computer itself\n\"\"\"\n\n# Disable \"Bare exception\" warning\n# pylint: disable=W0702\n\nimport time\n# Import mavutil\nfrom pymavlink import mavutil\n\ndef wait_conn():\n    \"\"\"\n    Sends a ping to stabilish the UDP communication and awaits for a response\n    \"\"\"\n    msg = None\n    while not msg:\n        master.mav.ping_send(\n            int(time.time() * 1e6), #

It is a build of the autopilot code using an ordinary C++ compiler, giving you a native executable that allows you to test the behaviour of the vehicle.\nInstallation\nTo configure and run SITL for the first time in your computer, take a look in Running SITL ArduPilot documentation.\nRunning ArduSub SITL\nThis part assumes that you have already set up SITL on your machine.\nFirst is necessary to be inside ArduSub folder.\ncd ardupilot/ArduSub\n\nTo execute SITL with sim_vehicle.py.\nsim_vehicle.py -L RATBeach --out=udp:0.0.0.0:14550 --map --console\n\nAfter that, ArduSub SITL will compile and start to run, you'll be able to connect it with QGroundControl and control it.\n\nFor more information about sim_vehicle.py and the options available, check:\nsim_vehicle.py --help\n\nRunning ArduSub SITL with Gazebo\nTo run ArduSub SITL with Gazebo, it's necessary to:\n\nInstall Gazebo-7 or Gazebo-8\nInstall freebuoyancy_gazebo plugin for buoyancy simulation.\nInstall ardupilot_gazebo/add_link plugin for ardupilot-gazebo communication. add_link is a branch that provides actuation over sdf links, after the git clone, it's necessary to run git checkout add_link.\nRun BlueRov2 Gazebo model\n\nDownload bluerov_ros_playground\n git clone https://github.com/patrickelectric/bluerov_ros_playground\n\n\nRun Gazebo model\n cd bluerov_ros_playground\n source gazebo.sh\n gazebo worlds/underwater.world -u\n # Start the simulation\n\n\n\n\nExecute ArduPilot SITL\n sim_vehicle.py -f gazebo-bluerov2 -L RATBeach --out=udp:0.0.0.0:14550 --console\n\n\n\nThe console will start to display the output if the connection was successful.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nCheck if all dependencies are installed via install some required packages.\nIf you are running an Unix OS, it's possible also to install missing dependencies with your package manager or pip.\n\n\nBe sure that mavproxy is installed with whereis mavproxy, pip list | grep mavproxy -i or just mavproxy.\nIf mavproxy is not installed, please run the install packages script (described in step 1 of this troubleshooting) or install the packages manually.\n\n\nCheck if ArduPilot tools are in your system PATH. It's possible to check with echo $PATH | grep ardupilot, the result should contains */ardupilot/Tools/autotest path.\nCheck again add some directories to your search path.\n\n\nCheck if all ardupilot/modules folders are populated.\nIt's necessary to use git and update/sync all submodules after the first installation, check cloning with the command line.\n\n\nIf using SITL's --speedup command you need to set MAVProxy's heartbeat output to match the speedup rate\nExample set heartbeat 8\n\n\n\n"},"developers/gps-positioning.html":{"url":"developers/gps-positioning.html","title":"GPS Positioning","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPS Positioning\nThe ROV autopilot is capable of utilizing an external positioning system to perform autonomous maneuvers like station keeping, 'click to go here', transects, and pre-planned waypoint missions. All GPS/positioning functionality in ArduSub is IN DEVELOPMENT. The position-enabled flight modes are not considered stable. However, a positioning system may be integrated in order to display the position of the vehicle on the Ground Control Station map. This can be done without making use of the position-enabled flight modes, and this sort of operation is considered stable.\nForwarding NMEA data to companion\n The first step to using ArduSub with a positioning system is to get the positioning system data into the autopilot. The Companion computer in the ROV listens for NMEA data on udp port 27000. You can forward NMEA data to this port, and the ROV will automatically use that for it's gps position. The NMEA data can come from a USBL or other positioning system, or from an application that is synthesizing a GPS position using computer vision, motion capture, or other means. A useful application for bridging NMEA data between a COM port on the surface computer and the udp port on the ROV is the NMEA Router by Neal Arundale.\nThe positioning system must report the number of satellites, and the satellites must be greater than 6 for the autopilot to accept the position as a valid lock. When a valid position and lock is detected by the autopilot, the main LED on the autopilot will change from blue to green.\nOn a pi terminal, enter the command screen -r nmearx to see if the data is correctly making it's way into the ROV system. Enter ctrl+A, then d to 'detach' from the screen and return to the pi terminal.\nAutopilot configuration\nThere is some configuration that needs to be done on the autopilot in order for the absolute positioning to perform correctly. These parameters need to be set:\n\nGPS_TYPE = MAV(14) (This is done automatically by the same application that listens for data on port 27000)\nEK2_GPS_TYPE = 2D Position(2) (We don't want to use the 3D position, we get very good depth measurements from the pressure sensor)\n\nThe Autopilot and the positioning system need to agree on where North is. Turn the vehicle until the autopilot indicates that it is facing north, and check that the positioning system reports the same heading. If the positioning system does not provide a heading estimate for the vehicle, move the vehicle forward towards North, and make sure that the positioning system reflects this accurately.\nIf the two systems do not agree on North:\n\nCalibrate the compass on the autopilot\nVerify the magnetic heading of the autopilot, change the COMPASS_DEC parameter if neccessary\nOffset the positioning system heading to match the autopilot heading. If this is not possible offset the autopilot heading with the COMPASS_DEC parameter to match the positioning system heading\n\nThe autopilot navigation filter needs to be tuned to the characteristics of the positioning system. Many factors can affect the tuning requirements including: Accuracy/precision of the positioning system, position update frequency, position update delay behind inertial measurements, etc. The navigation filter parameters can be found here.\nIf the position-enabled flight modes are to be used, the autopilot position controller needs to be tuned. In QGC, check the 'Show advanced settings' option in the General tab of the Application Setup menu, and restart the application. There will be a Tuning tab on the Vehicle Setup page that can be used to facilitate tuning the position controller. The parameters of interest are those with 'XY' in the name in the 'Position Controller' section.\nSending GPS position to ROV\nIt's possible to send position information to the ROV via socket or MAVLink message.\nThis is an alternative for using a system that does not provide NMEA output. I.e: SLAM, visual odometry and etc.\nSocket via MAVProxy\nThe GPSInput module (command module load GPSInput inside MAVProxy command line) of MAVProxy can be used to send position information to the ROV, this module uses socket communication to allow a simple interface layer. The default port is 25100 but can be changed with the parameterGPSInput.port (command set GPSInput.port port_number). The GPS_TYPE parameter of the vehicle need to be MAV to allow the communication.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport time\nimport socket\nimport json\n\nfrom os import system\n\nsockit = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsockit.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\nsockit.setblocking(0)\n\nwhile True:\n    result = {}\n    result['time_usec'] = 0             #Timestamp (micros since boot or Unix epoch)\n    result['gps_id'] = 0                #ID of the GPS for multiple GPS inputs\n    result['ignore_flags'] = 8|16|32    #Flags indicating which fields to ignore (see GPS_INPUT_IGNORE_FLAGS enum).

There is no guarantee that the DVL integration will work for any particular application.\nSupported DVLs\nThe Waterlinked A50 DVL is the only supported DVL at the moment in the beta integration.\nA50 DVL configuration\nThe DVL must be configured with a static IP address of 192.168.2.95. Follow Water Linked's instructions here.\nCompanion Software\nA recent version of the companion software is required to use the DVL integration.\nInstalling Companion software\nThe DVL support is available from Companion 0.0.31, which can be installed normally, or updated to from an earlier standard Companion version.\nUsers with a previous version of the DVL functionality (installed via a custom branch) should access the new version by flashing a clean install, rather than attempting to update directly from the custom branch.\nDVL configuration in Companion\nThe DVL driver introduces a new interface to the http://192.168.2.2:2770/waterlinked page.\n\nDriver Enable:\nEnables or disables the DVL Driver\nDVL IP Adress:\nInital IP where the driver will try to find the DVL. The driver always attempts to find Waterlinked-dvl.local (mDNS hostname) in the local network, if that fails, it falls back to the IP address in this field.\nOrientation:\nOrientation of the DVL: Down is the suggested use, where the DVL points to the ocean floor, Forward is an untested mode where the dvl is mounted forward to lock position to a vertical surface in front of it.\nUse as Rangefinder:\nAllows the DVL to be used as a rangefinder (shown in QGC).\nRestart DVL Service:\nRestarts the DVL service.\nSet New Origin:\nUsed for dead reckoning; this makes the ROV show up in QGC at the selected location. The position displayed in QGC is calculated by the autopilot independently of the position showed in the Water Linked DVL web interface, which is calculated by the DVL itself.\nStatus:\nShows the current Driver status, useful for troubleshooting.\nArduSub Firmware\nThe DVL data is sent by the VISION_POSITION_DELTA mavlink message. This message is supported in ArduSub 4.1-beta and onward. The ArduSub 4.1-beta firmware is recommended for testing with DVL.\nInstalling the ArduSub beta firmware\nClick beta under the update pixhawk section in the System Page.\nPIDs and Other Important Parameters\nThese parameters must be configured to the recommended values for DVL integration to perform correctly:\nUse mavlink2:\nSERIAL0_PROTOCOL 2\nUse EKF3 for the odometry support\nEK3_ENABLE 1\nAHRS_EKF_TYPE 3\nEK2_ENABLE 0\nEnable odometry support\nVISO_TYPE 1\nSpecify an external navigation source in ekf3\nEK3_SRC1_POSXY 6\nEK3_SRC1_VELXY 6\nSuggested gains\nPSC_POSXY_P 2.0\nPSC_POSZ_P  1.0\nPSC_VELXY_D 0.8\nPSC_VELXY_I 0.5\nPSC_VELXY_P 5.0\nPSC_VELZ_P  5.0\nOperation\nPosition Hold\nAfter setup, reboot the ROV. The Status field in the Waterlinked page should read Running.... The QGC will announce \"EKF3 IMU0 STARTED RELATIVE AIDING\" and then \"EKF3 IMU0 FUSING ODOMETRY\". This means the DVL input is being fused and you can switch to POSHOLD mode to use it.\nTracking on map\nTo track the ROV position in the QGC map view, go to the Waterlinked page, place the pin in the starting position, and click \"Set New Origin\".\n"},"developers/wireless-topside.html":{"url":"developers/wireless-topside.html","title":"Wireless Topside","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless Topside Connection\nThese instructions assume that you have already set up your ROV to the surface computer via the tether and static IP of 192.168.2.1 on the surface computer, according to the directions in the Network Setup section. These instructions were compiled using the TP-LINK TL-WR802N router.\nTo begin, power on the ROV, and connect via Ethernet. Open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.2.2:8088. Click the 'Open Terminal' button in the upper right corner. Enter this command to remove the Raspberry Pi's static IP assignment on the Ethernet interface:\nsudo sed -i 's/ip=192.168.2.2//' /boot/cmdline.txt\n\nDisconnect power from the ROV.\nNow we need to set up the router. We will start by resetting the router to the factory defaults. Connect power to the router, and hold down the 'Reset' button for 15 seconds. Disconnect power from the router, and power it on again.\nConnect the surface computer to the router's wireless network, using the network name and password printed on the label on the side of the router. After you have connected to the router's wireless network, open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.0.1. Enter the default username (admin) and password (admin).\nIn the Operation Mode menu, choose the 'Access Point' option and save the settings and reboot the router.\n\nAfter the router reboots, reconnect the surface computer to the router's wireless network. Open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.0.254 and log into the router again.\nIn the Network menu, set the Type to 'Static IP' and set the IP Address to 192.168.2.3. Then save the settings and reboot the router. Disconnect power from the router.\n\nNext, remove the static IP assignment from the surface computer, and configure the Ethernet interface as a DHCP client (this is the default 'automatic' configuration).\nConnect the router to the tether with an Ethernet patch cable and connect power to the router. Power on the ROV. Connect the surface computer to the router's wireless network. Open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.2.3 and log into the router again.\nIn the DHCP menu, go to the DHCP Client List sub-menu. Write down the MAC Addresses for the surface computer and the Raspberry Pi.\n\nGo to the Address Reservation sub-menu, and reserve 192.168.2.1 for the MAC of the surface computer and 192.168.2.2 for the MAC of the Raspberry Pi. Disconnect then reconnect power to the router.\n\nConnect the surface computer to the router's wireless network. Open QGroundControl, and it will connect to the ROV wirelessly!\n"},"developers/developers.html":{"url":"developers/developers.html","title":"Build ArduSub","keywords":"","body":"\n  ⚠️  ARCHIVE NOTICE ⚠️  \n  This documentation is no longer being maintained!\n  \n    The new ArduSub docs are located in the ArduPilot wiki.\n    The Companion Computer Software is also archived, and has been replaced by BlueOS.\n    For Control Station Software, see QGroundControl or Cockpit (our new alternative).\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\nHow to Get the Code\nArduSub is hosted and maintained on github. You need to clone the repository to have full code access including submodules.\n    git clone https://github.com/ardupilot/ardupilot.git\n    cd ardupilot\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n\nCompiling\nBefore compiling ArduSub, first checkout the ArduSub-stable tag into a new branch (here we call it new-branch):\ngit fetch --tags\ngit checkout ArduSub-stable -b new-branch\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nTo set up your build environment, follow these instructions:\n\nMac Instructions\nLinux Instructions\nWindows Instructions\n\n\nNote Skip the clone instructions in the links above, as they could cause you to use master instead of ArduSub-stable and lead the install scripts to install a different set of tools.\n\nWAF\nWaf is a global build system for ArduPilot repository, it's necessary to be inside the root folder of ArduPilot to use it.\nYou can check how to use waf with:\n./waf --help\nTo configure waf to build ArduSub for Pixhawk 1:\n./waf configure --board Pixhawk1\nAnd to compile:\n./waf sub\nThe firmware file will be created at ardupilot/build/Pixhawk1/bin/ardusub.apj\nUploading Locally\nThis only works with a direct USB connection to the Pixhawk, and to upload the code:\nwaf: Use --upload with the vehicle type (only works after configuring and building with waf before).\n./waf --upload sub\nUploading Remotely\nWith an Ethernet tether and companion computer, it is possible to flash the Pixhawk firmware through the companion computer - no need to directly access the Pixhawk.\nFlashing Via Web Interface\nNavigate to 192.168.2.2:2770/system in your browser. Under the 'Pixhawk Firmware Update' section, click 'Browse' and select the firmware file (.apj) saved on your computer. Click 'Upload' and wait for the flashing process to complete.\nRunning\nThe code begins running immediately once uploaded. For Linux-based autopilots, it must be launched or started with launch script. Please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.\nMaking a Custom Configuration\nOne of the biggest additions to the ArduSub code is a six degree-of-freedom motor library that allows a wide variety of motor configurations to be set up easily. The motors libraries for each configuration are built on a set of higher-level motor classes as follows:\nAP_Motors\n    |---- AP_MotorsMulticopter\n                   |---- AP_MotorsMatrix\n                                |---- AP_Motors6DOF\nTo add a new motor configuration, you will need to add your custom motor setup to AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. Find the following line, and add your frame configuration there. The frame is configured at boot according to the FRAME_CONFIG parameter. You will need to change this parameter to CUSTOM to use your custom frame.\ncase AS_MOTORS_CUSTOM_FRAME:\n    // Put your custom motor setup here\nThe behavior of each motor will be defined by its assigned contributions to each of the 6 degrees of freedom in AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. You can use the other frame configurations as a reference guide to defining your own custom configuration. Here is the BlueROV1 frame configuration as an example:\n\n\n\nMotor #\nRoll Factor\nPitch Factor\nYaw Factor\nThrottle Factor\nForward Factor\nLateral Factor\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n-1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n\n\n3\n-0.5\n0.5\n0\n0.45\n0\n0\n\n\n4\n0.5\n0.5\n0\n0.45\n0\n0\n\n\n5\n0\n-1.0\n0\n1.0\n0\n0\n\n\n6\n-0.25\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\nUsing the New Custom Configuration\nTo use the newly created frame, set the FRAME_CONFIG parameter to \"Custom\" in QGroundControl and then reboot the flight controller.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf something goes wrong while compiling:\nCheck the compiling section to set up your environment.\nArduSub is only compatible with GCC 6. Be sure that \"gcc-arm-none-eabi 6\" is your \"PATH\" env with: echo $PATH | grep gcc-arm-none-eabi.\nIt's also possible to add custom paths for the compiler with export PATH=/your_path/gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q2-update/bin/:$PATH. Run ./waf configure --board Pixhawk1 again if compiling with WAF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored by Blue Robotics. Code released under the GPLv3 License.
