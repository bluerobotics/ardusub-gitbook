# ArduSub Firmware

## Versioning

There are three flavors of ArduSub firmware:

- Stable (3.5): The recommended build for most users.
- Beta (3.5-rc2): A pre-release of a stable build, used for testing and bugfixes before officially labeling a build as stable. The versions for the these builds are suffixed with *-rcx*, where rc stands for release candidate, and x is a number that is incremented as the beta is updated.
- Development (3.6-dev): Development build, updated frequently. This build should only be used in practice by developers and advanced users. The versions for these builds are suffixed with *-dev*.

Precompiled ArduSub binaries are available [here](http://firmware.us.ardupilot.org/Sub/). **Note** Binaries are provided for many platforms, but only the Pixhawk 1 (PX4-v2 platform) is thoroughly tested and supported.

## What Version is Installed?

To find out what firmware version is installed on your autopilot, navigate to the *Summary* tab of the *Vehicle Setup* page. The firmware version will be listed under the *Frame* section.

## Updating

It is **highly recommended** to [save your parameters](/operators-manual/parameters.md#saving-and-loading) to a file before updating your firmware. To update your firmware using QGroundControl, go to the *Vehicle Setup Page* and click the *Firmware* tab, then plug your autopilot into the computer with a USB cable. Choose 'ArduPilot Flight Stack', then choose your desired version to load. Beta and Development options are available after clicking the *Advanced settings* checkbox.
