# Software Components

There are three major software components involved in the operation of ArduSub:

- [ArduSub](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot): ArduSub is the autopilot software responsible for processing pilot input and controlling the ROV. ArduSub is the 'brains' of the ROV.
- [QGroundControl](https://github.com/bluerobotics/qgroundcontrol): QGroundControl is the user interface for operating the ROV.
- [Companion](https://github.com/bluerobotics/companion): The Raspberry Pi *Companion Computer* runs software that relays communications between the autopilot and QGroundControl via Ethernet communications. The Companion software also streams HD video to QGroundControl.

Here is a typical diagram of the software components and their interactions:
